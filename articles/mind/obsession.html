            <p>In LCHF there is still somewhat of a carbohydrate loading phase pre-race. This isn’t the 500-600g of
                carbohydrate that is recommended for most athletes in the three days before (which generally leaves an
                athlete feeling lethargic and bloated), however it is more than he would generally eat. Don’t forget
                that **tapering** for a race is, in effect, carbo loading, as the muscle glycogen stores are not
                depleted during training and it allows them the chance to be replenished and not in the deficit they
                normally are. Based on Rowlands paper which showed that a higher fat diet with a preload of
                carbohydrates, he’s dialled in his approach that Dan now feels works really well for him. He lifts his
                carbohydrate intake from the 80-100g he typically eats in the days prior. On the Wednesday (for a
                Saturday race), he will include additional potato or sweet potato in his evening meal, taking him to
                ~125g carbs per day. This increases to ~175g per day on Thursday and Friday (the two days before the
                race) – including fruit alongside the potato or sweet potato. In addition, he makes sure snacks etc on
                hand are low carbohydrate so not to be caught out during the lead up period with having to rely on the
                petrol station or four square options. If you do have to rely on these, and are looking for lower
                carbohydrate, then biltong, cheese snacks, even lower carbohydrate protein bars can be good stop gaps.
                On race morning before Dan’s Kona race he opted for was porridge: oats with a bit of Super Starch added,
                which is a slow release carbohydrate to not inhibit fat burning, and is a higher molecular weight
                carbohydrate, so it is easier to digest. </p>

            <p>During the race: </p>

            <p>Dan follows what practitioners advocate: a ‘train low, race high’ model. Ideally, the train low approach
                has enabled you to increase your efficiency to burn fat as a fuel source in addition to using
                carbohydrate that you have stored or take on board, thus maximising the amount of fuel you have
                available. Dan takes in around 50g carbohydrate per hour and, because he is very efficient at burning
                fat, he doesn’t need as much carbohydrate as he would otherwise. A real benefit of this is that it
                minimises the likelihood of gut issues many endurance athletes experience during a long event – the more
                carbohydrate fuel you have to take on board, the more opportunity there is to get the dose wrong.
                Importantly though, the more fatigued you become, the more your body will divert blood supply away from
                the gut to the muscles, and thus impacting on your ability to digest the fuel. During Kona Dan used
                energy blocks with gels on the bike, and a couple of gels with some swigs of sports drink or coke during
                the run. </p>

            <p>Finally, post-race, Dan gets back on board the LCHF approach fairly swiftly, as he has seen the impact
                that a higher carbohydrate fuelling day has on his blood glucose level across the course of the
                following week. It certainly doesn’t reduce down to normal levels the day after, and it’s likely that
                inflammation and muscle damage impacts on this too. Your best bet is to (as soon as possible) get back
                to your LCHF diet and help your recovery process. </p>
