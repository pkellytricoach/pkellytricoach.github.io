            <p>So we need goals. But then those goals can only come to fruition via process.</p>

            <p>When the excitement of a new goal grows old, when the glitter wears off... what do you do?</p>

            <p>There are no shortcuts or hacks to the performances we are after.</p>

            <p>Do you focus on the next shiny thing that catches your eye? Do you choose comfort over discomfort? Or do
                you knuckle down and simply do the work.</p>

            <p>There is only one real competitor and that is you against you. And you will be both your biggest
                supporter but also your biggest foe.</p>

            <p>Folks want to know how to get mentally tough. We can read all the books we want, do written exercises
                etc. But real mental toughness only comes from choosing to be tough in the moment. Embracing to
                endure!</p>

            <p>Coach wants you to do a 5 hour bike but weather is pants and turbo looms or when you're feeling tired or
                have every excuse under the sun. This is when you need to simply say screw it lets do it.</p>

            <p>4k swim set! "It's bloody monotonous & boring". Hey, guess what? Training is more often than not
                monotonous & boring. We don't always get to run in the trails with our friends on a glorious day or
                cycle on stunning roads with amazing scenery. But we are not in this for training 'entertainment'. We
                are in this to achieve the big audacious goals we have mapped out.</p>

            <p>You are the obstacle.</p>

            <p>Choose not to settle within the session when you are meant to be pushing it. I know there are some
                sessions I dread, but we (ahem, I) need to learn to deal mentally with each session. More power
                intervals then normal, so I will back off slightly as I mightn't be able to handle my usual wattage, No
                we say screw it let's do it. If we blow we blow. Don't be afraid to fail it!</p>

            <p>Listen to you self chatter.. Is this sabatauging you?</p>

            <p>A great goal this year is to find comfort in discomfort. Finding magic in the mundane. Embrace the
                sessions we dread.</p>

            <p>Go ahead and dream or think big. But back that with bigger action and that does not mean epic 7 hour
                rides or hard track intervals it just means sticking to the consistency (day-in-day-out process) and
                working your mind every single opportunity you have.</p>

            <p>Get after it.</p></div>
