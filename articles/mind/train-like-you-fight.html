            <p>It is a shame that most people will never explore the limitations of their bodies. Triathletes are not
                exempt from this. You can climb the same old hill, year after year, or you can conquer the mountain of
                uncertainty that will require you to explore your mental and physical limits. Do you want to finish, or
                do you want to race? Do you want to finish, or do you want to win? Ironman is a costly event that
                requires many long hours of training and time away from family, friends, and social events. You owe it
                to yourself, family, and friends to go ALL IN on this grueling event. While treading water in Kailua
                Bay, waiting for the canon to set you free, remember: This effort is for the rest of your life!</p>

            <p>Training scenarios: Train like you fight. You will not rise to the occasion. You are a product of your
                training. If you don’t push the limits in training, then you will not start the race knowing what you
                are truly capable of.</p>

            <p>“Race Pace” is a term that is used to describe your best effort on any given day. Suffer more in
                training, and bleed less in the fight. Racing is a reward for the training you have done. Digging deep
                in training will make race day seem like a break from continuously training in a state of fatigue. Learn
                to become comfortable in an uncomfortable environment. Carfrae: “Most people are unwilling to hurt to
                the next level.” Run 5:30/mile intervals on the track so that I can run 7:00/mile pace in the Ironman.
                Never miss an opportunity to push yourself to an uncomfortable state in training. Hold yourself
                accountable: If you are able to push the tempo in a bigger gear, then shift up. When things start to
                feel uncomfortable in the run, analyze what is happening with your form- “Head to Toe, Treat as You Go:”
                Are my shoulders tensing up? Am I running tall? Am I closing the angle in my elbows? Am I slouching in
                the hips? Am I leading with the knees? Am I bouncing? Is my cadence slowing? Am I leaning forward at the
                ankles? Fix it! There is no such thing as quitting: Quitting, or a bad day, results in loss of life in
                combat. Quitting in training will make it easy to quit in the race. If you make a nutritional mistake in
                training, and hit the wall, drag yourself home at a reduced tempo, but don’t quit.Live in the moment:
                You cannot control the past or the future, only what is happening right now. </p>
            <p>Treat every interval as if it were the last one of the set. Focus ONLY on the interval that you are
                completing at that moment. Thinking about “how many more” intervals you have to do will not allow you to
                put the quality in each
                and every effort. Thinking about how badly you want to get off the bike and start the run will not help
                your ability to remain focused on the bike effort. Never miss an opportunity to get faster, stronger,
                better than you were yesterday. There should be no question on race morning whether you have done enough
                to be there. Every training session is another opportunity to perform better than you did last time.
                Down hill sections on your bike ride is an opportunity to hammer downhill in the aero bars, thus
                enhancing your bike handling skills rather than lying up. You will see the look of defeat on the faces
                of those who are left wondering on race morning if they have earned the right to be there. This will not
                be you.</p>

            <p>Training Constants: Keep it simple stupid (KISS) No HR and Power meters, No GPS (Pace). The body does not
                know what a mile is; however, it does react to time. Do not allow an electronic gadget determine your
                ability on race day. Data is fine in the lab, but labs do not mimic race day. The body is never fully
                recovered (at least it shouldn’t it be) during training; so don’t allow a gadget to dictate your ability
                when you are fully tapered for an Ironman. The body will tell you all you need to know in order to set
                the pace. You must explore limits in training- the worst that can happen if you blow up in a training
                event is that you’ll learn where to set the bar during your next session. Let the rabbits go- you will
                see them later on the course. Train your stomach: No matter how long the session, utilize the same
                calorie concentration for each bike and run event. During the swim portion, there are No calorie bottles
                during the race, so don’t use them at the pool. (Train like you fight) 70.3 races provide great
                opportunities to explore nutritional details. Utilize what is on the course. Keep it simple. Two bottle
                set-up: One with calories, one with water. No Calories w/out water, no water w/out calories. Salt
                tablets, regardless of conditions. Breakfast is the same every day of the year- same on race morning. No
                surprises on race morning.Ironman is an individual event, so the majority of your training should be
                done on your own. (Train like you fight) There is more than enough time to socialize at the coffee shop
                when the training is complete. Don’t look for answers: Once you find what works FOR YOU, stick to the
                formula. Consistency in your training plan will out-perform any new “whiz-bang” idea in Triathlete
                Magazine. Don’t be tempted by the “Good-Idea Fairy.” She is out there, and she knows that Triathletes
                will buy anything. There is no one-size-fits-all plan online that will get you to Kona.Every workout has
                a specific goal. Long bike and run are the only workouts that do not require specific instructions.
                Quality, Quality, Quality.</p>
