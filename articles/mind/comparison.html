            <h4 class="mb-5">Comparison is the thief of joy</h4>
            <p>This is a post I’ve been meaning to write for a long time. Triathlon (and I’m sure most sporting
                endeavours) falls victim to the comparison trap. I see it all the time.</p>

            <p>David Roche had a great quote ‘No matter who you are and what you do, you can feel inadequate if you put
                your mind to it.’ If you look hard enough, you will ALWAYS find someone better then the current version
                of you. ‘</p>

            <p>Myself and Daragh were talking to a friend of his at the Mullingar half marathon a few weeks back on
                Paddys day. He was training for Ironman Cork. He felt going under 10 hours was out of his reach given
                the course profile, so he felt the training was a waste of time and couldn’t wait till it was over. This
                is Paddy’s day. The race is the end of June and already he was wishing the months away. I didn’t say
                anything but inside I was ‘Man, you got this all wrong’. Daragh jokingly asked him to know his why. His
                why was to break 10 hours (outcome), now he felt this was unachievable, it was all a complete waste of
                time. Take time to take this in. It’s incredible. </p>

            <p>Ironman training is a selfish endeavour. It takes precious time away from spending quality time with
                loved ones and friends. You owe it not only to yourself but more to your family members & friends to
                really love everything about what your are doing. Remember you are not just wasting your own time if
                you’re not enjoying it, you’re wasting the time of all your loved ones. I know Adrienne doesn’t give a
                shit if I break X hours, she just cares that I’m happy and enjoying it all. </p>

            <p>About 10 years ago, I was going pretty well in triathlon. For a couple of years I was really pushing
                really hard and burning candles at every end in work/social/training. Two bouts of pneumonia leading to
                a long term lung condition that I’ll have for life. Throw in nasty anxiety bouts, all in all a pretty
                nasty few years of my life. Now I’m through all that and training and racing, I just love it. And feel
                so privileged to be able to train and compete and get the most from myself regardless of time and
                category. Sure I want to do well and would love to qualify for Hawaii some day, but really I feel so
                privileged to do this sport and if X beats me, then brilliant for him for having an awesome race. I read
                a brilliant book years ago called ‘the good life’. It’s a modern blueprint on how to live like a stoic
                and use the learnings of Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, and Seneca to live a great life. One of the
                techniques cited in the book is called ‘Negative visualisation’. The core of this idea is to visualize
                negative outcomes in your life. It’s a really powerful technique. You didn’t have the race you want,
                well imagine you have rheumatoid arthritis and struggle to walk pain free. First and foremost, this
                technique makes you quickly appreciate what you have in life. Your health, your family, your
                opportunities, and more. It’s realizing that you are blessed and so fortunate to be able to participate
                in these amazing events that bring us to cool places. This quickly puts things in perspective.</p>

            <p>Lucy Gossage is an amazing athlete. She was a former professional triathlete while working as an
                oncologist. This was something she said in a podcast some time back :</p>

            <p>‘Ironman is about suffering for nine to ten hour Cancer is about suffering for much longer. But no matter
                how much I’m hurting in a race, I know I’m choosing to suffer and can make it stop at any point. Cancer
                patients don’t get that choice and remembering that helps me to embrace the pain rather than running
                from it’</p>

            <p>While she was talking about suffering during races, it can also equate to how we feel after a bad race.
                We have a choice how to frame this result. Cancer patients don’t. We need to remember this.</p>

            <p>We may have started triathlon to shed some weight or do something cool which morphed into chasing PBs and
                beating XYZ in our triathlon club. No one cares apart from you. Instead of focusing on results, how
                about cherishing the daily moments that let you make memories and find joy along the way. That feeling
                when your legs are smashed because you have given it your all. When you didn’t think you would get to
                the 10th interval and you ace all 20 of them. This is the good stuff. Sure have big audacious goals but
                understand that reaching these goals are a pleasant by-product of LOVING the daily grind along the way
                for many many years and understanding our progression is not a linear progression..</p>

            <p>Think about where you were with training and racing 3/5 years ago. Now think of the worst race you had in
                that span. It’s not all that tragic in retrospect, right? You aren’t your best race, you aren’t your
                worst race. In fact, you aren’t your race results at all.</p>

            <p>The ego monster can never be satisfied. The finish line drug requires bigger and bigger doses to get you
                high.</p>

            <p>The goal is never to use our training and racing to answer the question “Am I enough?” Instead, the goal
                is to compete in triathlon events knowing “I am enough, no matter what.”</p>

            <p>Little by little, removing comparison as a means to define success in training and racing and chasing
                external validation can help us triathletes find unconditional self-acceptance and longevity in the
                sport. </p>

            <p>None of this stuff matters except the memories we make.</p>

            <p>Smile every mile, thank every volunteer and encourage every other participant you are racing
                alongside.</p>

            <p>I know I’ll be adopting this to Lanzarote in a few months regardless of the outcome. Only good memories,
                thats my motto. </p>

            <p>I’ll leave you with a snippet from the brilliant ’The Universe Doesn’t Give a Flying Fuck About You’ by
                Johnny B. Truan.</p>

            <p>‘Everything dies. Everything. You were born with a terminal disease, just like everything else that has
                ever existed. You, your lamp, the sun, and the Bee Gees all have that in common.</p>

            <p>And you were worried that trying something new might make you look dumb or that your business might not
                make any money. *Edit for us triathletes: ‘My training partner beat me by 9 mins or I had a mechanical
                and a shit race as a result’ ‘I was only 68th in my age group’ ‘My FTP is only 240, Aidans is 290’</p>

            <p>What the fuck is wrong with you?’</p>

            <p>Race and train for joy or not at all. </p>
