            <p>It happens from doing. It's happens from turning up in your pain cave and doing the things you know you
                need to do when you don't want too.</p>

            <p>We make thousands of choices every single day. These build or break us. But the better an athlete becomes
                at making the right choices in the moment and facing those uncomfortable feeling or fears, embracing
                them even, then this is where we push beyond anticipated limits. It's making that choice to endure the
                uncomfortable when you least feel like it.</p>

            <p>Chimp brain has a great ability to justify quitting. Giving us all the reasons in the world for easing up
                or cutting a session short. Doing this once it makes it infinitely easier to do it again. Excuses are
                like assholes. We all have them in our lives. The pain cave or a boring multi-lap course are some of the
                best places to develop the ability to over rule our chimp brain that is telling us to stop or cut the
                session 2-3 intervals short.</p>

            <p>There’s no way around it — It's gonna be uncomfortable. Whether that’s monotony or intensity, it doesn’t
                matter. Why fearful of being it? Look for opportunity. Embrace the challenge. We can improve our ability
                to endure the uncomfortableness instead of running away from it and avoiding it at every opportunity.
                Think about the first time you ever did a tough, near-impossible session. It was probably rotten, and
                you probably didn't even complete it. The next time you showed up for that same session, it was - even
                if only by the tiniest margin - a little bit easier. But easier in a more manageable way. Eventually,
                with patience and consistency, it becomes familiar. The brain became more accustomed to the suffering as
                your body adapted to the physiological demands. Pretty soon you found that sweet spot, and you could
                "settle" into that rhythm of working hard, deep in the suffer, but sustaining your intensity to hold on
                for longer.</p>

            <p>Don’t choose the path of least resistance in that moment and clap yourself on the back after for not
                doing so. Use positive self-talk to get you through those tough moments. You have to be willing to dig
                deep into the well of your own suffering. Expect voices whispering criticism, yelling at you to stop,
                coaxing you back towards mediocrity - laugh them off. </p>

            <p>Don't be afraid to fail it. </p>

            <p>One thing that nearly every champion has in common is their lack of excuses. Unless ill or injured, they
                just get it done. End of.</p>

            <p>Suffer more in training, bleed less in the fight! </p></div>
