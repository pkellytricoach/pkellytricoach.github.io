            <p>Buying List</p>

            <p>Triathlon is such an expensive sport, so sorry to keep adding.</p>

            <p>Swimming</p>

            <p>Pull Buoy - bigger the better. I like the HUUB big buoy. Particularly for weaker swimmers (ie me) which allow us to get fit and strong without have to over think body position. Link here</p>

            <p>Band / Ankle Lock - I use the Finis brand one and put it on during pulling sets, I use a figure of 8 when putting on. Too loose otherwise which allows kicking. Defeats the purpose. Link here</p>

            <p>Paddles - Use paddles to not only develop strength but also at times limit how much we can aerobically whack ourselves. Most paddles way too big and significantly slow down cadence. I like the TYR Catalyst Green. Finis agility is also very good.</p>

            <p>Swim Fins - help develop a more effective kick. Use during warm up s+ kick sets to help swim mechanics.</p>

            <p>Tempo Trainer - I need to work on my cadence so use the Finis Tempo Trainer to help me dial that in. It’s also very good for the red mist type sessions we do as we near our goal race. Link here</p>

            <p>Body Maintenance</p>

            <p>Massage balls - Find these great. Really good for working Piriformis, Gastroc, Soleus. You get 3 in a pack, so can leave one in work etc. Link here</p>

            <p>Lacrosse Ball - This is awesome for back. Link here</p>

            <p>Larger Massage Ball - You need a bigger ball for Psoas (you need to be working this!). Link here</p>

            <p>Foam Roller - Quads. I use either Trigger Point Therapy one, or this one Other</p>

            <p>Headphones - Love these Plantronics. Don’t leave my house for a run without them. Fit nicely in my ear. No messing about fiddling during run. Link here</p>

            <p>Blender - Must for post exercise. I have the this Nutribullet. Really recommend. Does a fine job on crushed avocado’s and other frozen fruit. Think it’s a model up from previous versions. Motor seems stronger.</p>

            <p>Salt tab holder - Found these great in Hamburg + Cascais last year. Link here</p>
