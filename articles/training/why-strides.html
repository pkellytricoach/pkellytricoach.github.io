            <h4 class="mb-5">Why Strides</h4>
            <p>Openers/Strides – are 15-to-30-second bursts of speed up to the fastest pace you can go while staying
                totally smooth and comfortable (it’s not a sprint). This is usually about the pace you could hold for
                two to four minutes.</p>

            <p>The primary benefit is improving running economy, or reducing the amount of energy it takes to run fast.
                By doing strides, your brain and muscles get better at operating smoothly and comfortably at all
                paces—not just stride pace. They improve how your brain sends signals and how your body interprets them,
                reducing ground contact time, better transmitting energy throughout the kinetic chain from foot to hips
                (and even upper body) and turning it in to forward motion. These are the neuromuscular benefits which we
                talked about in another post.</p>

            <p>The secondary benefits are for cardiac stroke output (increasing the amount of blood your heart pumps
                with each beat), muscle strength (improving power output) and the aerobic system (improving
                oxygen-processing power).</p>

            <p>Lastly, they can also increase the amount of force your legs deliver with each stride. Think of running
                as a series of short, repeated jumps, like plyometrics. Strides make you jump quicker, faster and
                stronger. </p></div>
