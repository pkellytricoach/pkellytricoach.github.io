            <h4 class="mb-5">Not giving up on a session</h4>

            <p>We have said it before (<a href="http://embrace2endure.com/articles/training/consistency.html">Consistency
                is everything</a>) that
                no one training session will make or break your ultimate outcome. We are aiming to be the Warren Buffet
                of endurance training and hold a long term view. So don’t sweat it if a session doesn’t go the way you
                intended or if you have to miss a day (Read <a
                        href="http://embrace2endure.com/articles/training/life-getting-in-the-way.html">Shit
                    happens - when life gets in the way</a>)! Each day when we show up, we don’t know what our body is
                going to give us. We may be carrying a lot more fatigue from previous sessions or had a crap night
                sleep, fight with partner etc. Because of this we can’t expect our performance to be linear and always
                improving. That each session 'SHOULD' be better than the last. You are not a robot! </p>
            <p>
                However, what DOES
                make a difference is the decisions you make when things aren't going to plan. So if a session isn't
                going to plan and you feel
                like you should be swimming 1'40s, the easy choice is to give up, find an excuse, and give up and feel
                crap for the day. The difficult choice is to stay positive and have that conversation with your chimp
                brain. Right brain, I'm not feeling it today, but I'm going to give it my all and smile, so back off
                buddy and cool it with the criticisms. </p>
            <p>
                It's important that we have strategies in place to make the most
                of a less than ideal day and to improve next time! This could happen in a race! You start your session
                and only feel 70%. What is your strategy? Well forget numbers and give 100% of the 70% you have that day. Ditch the
                watch/power meter and focus on form/technique/breathing. Something anything except numbers. Tell
                yourself that maybe you are not holding wattage/pace etc but your NOT giving up! Period! Asking yourself
                to make the most of the cards you have been dealt at that time and not trying to control something you
                ultimately have no control over. </p>

            <p>
                Being able to overcome these tough moments is how we develop grit and
                build mental resilience and will ultimately help you when race day comes. To keep going when your brain
                is screaming at you to give up and winge. This is training. Not giving in, quitting, or allowing
                pace/power to decrease even more. Staying as CONSISTENT as you can on that day! When you struggle
                through a session, it builds character. Focusing on the things that are ultimately in your control.
                Decreasing tension in my shoulders, keeping my cadence up, maintaining a forward lean etc.</p>

            <p>Its easy to walk away from these sessions feeling down and mentally depleted. Its understanding the
                bigger picture, understanding perspective and consistency in training. Embrace this.</p>

            <p>If you have a bad day, you’re not alone! Learn from it, don’t give up when you want to, and move on! </p>
