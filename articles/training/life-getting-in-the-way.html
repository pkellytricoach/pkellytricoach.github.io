            <p>No matter best intentions sometimes things just get in the way.</p>

            <p>That’s why with long term consistency and the ability to roll with ‘life happens’ allows you to be ok with either missing a session or a major adjustment of said session.</p>

            <p>This happens all of us. Best intentions, but that meeting drags on an extra 30 mins, work travel, kid sick and tonnes more other life events.</p>

            <p>A quality session was in your plan. It was 75 mins on the turbo. You only have 40 to work with? What do you do? Well something is always better than nothing (exceptions to this rule when sick or injured). Yes, you missed the full session. But in your shortened session you touched on some of the efforts that were required. This allows you to maintain some consistency of what was intended.</p>

            <p>So the lesson here is life will throw curveballs and derail your best intentions.</p>

            <p>See what you CAN do and simply do that.</p>

            <p>Don’t overthink it.</p>

            <p>After all we do these things as a hobby that is meant to add value to our lives and not detract from it. Don’t beat yourself up about this. It’s one of the main reasons we don’t have a set day off in our schedule as life circumstances will force one.</p>    </section>
