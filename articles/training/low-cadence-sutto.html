            <p>This session is responsible for developing significant cycling strength – we will be doing it or very
                similar strands of it all year round. It is a typical sutto session. Essentially it teaches you to
                recruit dormant muscle fibres. It also does a great job at mitigating the catabolic (breaking down)
                effects of the longer endurance training done on the weekend. Monday/Tuesday is a perfect day for this
                session after a big aerobic block over the weekend. Because it’s repeatable it’s very useful as a
                benchmark week on week. Last week your felt great, this week not so. Why not? Sleep, stress, not into
                it?</p>

            <p>Bonus, this session can be done on a gym or spin bike when traveling.</p>

            <p>The intervals themselves are done at around 40-45rpm with VERY HARD resistance/ 1′ very easy recovery. We
                can use FTP as a guide here, but by all means adjust if it’s too hard or easy. My last FTP test was 276.
                I tend to do these at 130%. So thats an idea. Like I say, it may go up or down. If using Zwift for
                these, set it to 130 but dial down if need be. I use the Wahoo fitness App for these, I can adjust on
                the fly to whatever I want.</p>

            <p>We don’t want to be limited by watts or FTP for this. We want to go as high as we can without bouncing in
                the saddle. Do not do these intervals in a TT position. Very important.</p>

            <p>Since 50% of this session is recovery, your aerobic system is not taxed by the session. As muscularly
                challenging and hard as it is.</p>


            <p>STOMP those pedals!! We don’t care about perfect power throughout each pedal rotation. Stomp as hard as
                you can on the downstroke. Athletes need to focus more on the stomping than trying to smooth out pedal
                stroke or worse pull up on the pedal stroke which can injure hamstring. All the best time trialists
                stomp on the pedals from the 1 o’clock to the 5 o’clock. The stomp is key. It works.</p>

            <p>CUE: Push through your big toes to activate the glutes</p>
