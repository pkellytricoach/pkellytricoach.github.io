            <p>Most of our group are (ahem) ageing athletes. Meaning we most likely have to deal with little niggles on
                a daily basis.</p>

            <p>I think I speak for all of us is that we are all dealing with some issue, for me it’s typically calf and
                hip related. What I have to do .. to GET to be an athlete … is MANAGE (not cure, i’m not sure if it will
                ever go away) the daily niggles. So I include housekeeping and mobilisation in all our weekly plans. We
                do the same group of muscles every 3 days. We try and limit this work to 10-15 mins so it is manageable
                with life. Mostly we are trying to ingrain a habit. Much like brushing our teeth.</p>

            <p>We need to do everything in our control to NOT get injured as consistency is everything. I’ll say that
                again. Consistency is everything. So, to be a consistent athlete. This is the stuff I need to do to be a
                consistent athlete. Little bits every day.</p>

            <p>The other thing we need to add to this is simple core stuff. Front and side planks. 2-3 times front and
                both sides for about 60secs. Ensure correct form – straight as an arrow, stiff as a board comes to mind
                and if you haven’t been doing it start small. ie. build from 3x15secs to 20 to 30 and up to a minute.
                Sure we can get fancier but we don’t need to. Accumulation over time is the key. I live the 7 minute
                free plank app on App Store/Play Store. Disclaimer, I hate doing the plank. Out of all my sessions, this
                is perhaps the one I struggle the most with. The app is great. Don’t think just do EVERY SINGLE DAY.</p>

            <p>If you can’t find the time, then you’ll have all the time in the world when sidelined from injury due to
                neglect (akin to running your car and never changing the oil). The biggest obstacle to doing this daily
                housekeeping is simply yourself.</p>

            <p>Here is the goal I’m setting myself to do every single day:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Daily foam rolling - 2 muscle groups each day (watch videos from Onedrive folder)</li>
                <li>Plank App - 7 minute plank - Do this and mobility (below) as soon as I wake up, I struggle with this
                    one. I'm dont like plank :)
                </li>
                <li>Morning hydration as soon as I get up (big glass of water, 1/4 tea spoon Himalayan salt + slice of
                    lemon)
                </li>
                <li>Straight into my 5 min mobilisation routine to wake up the body, muscle activation etc (In our
                    shared videos)
                </li>
                <li>5 min meditation / breathing exercises</li>
            </ul>

            <p>What can we do to help ingrain these habits.</p>

            <p>I lay out my matt in my sitting room, so its staring at me the minute I get up. Honestly, right now I
                don't have to think of these things as it is ingrained. James Clear is awesome. Read his Atomic Books
                book.</p>

            <p>Hopefully by the time we get to the meat of our training next year, these will be ingrained, much like
                brushing our teeth.</p>

            <p>Like anything results are never overnight (even breaking down doesn’t happen overnight, it happens
                gradually and then swiftly). So zoom out, start doing and in a number of weeks you’ll notice some
                changes. </p>

            <p>James Clear gold.. 'You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
                Your goal is your desired outcome. Your system is the collection of daily habits that will get you
                there. This year, spend less time focusing on outcomes and more time focusing on the habits that precede
                the results.’</p>
