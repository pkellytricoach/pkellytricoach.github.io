            <p>Simon Ward – triathlon tips + Kona qualifying tips He is always so practical.</p>

            <p>Here they are:</p>

            <p>20 lessons that I like to remind myself of every now and again. In no order of importance and by no means
                an exclusive list.</p>

            <p>1. No one is at their fittest in January – So what if your mates are flying in the first week of the New
                Year. Unless they are racing then, it doesn’t matter</p>
            <p>2. How to have intensity discipline – too many athletes get sucked into training at someone else’s
                training intensity instead of their own for that day </p>
            <p>3. Your 3 key swim faults – If you can fix these most of the minor faults will be fixed too </p>
            <p>4. Training at MAF DOES work, you just need patience. </p>
            <p>5. The best way to get fitter is be consistent. </p>
            <p>6. For every 60 minutes of training there must be 15 minutes of strength and mobility work </p>
            <p>7. Sometimes to get faster you have to accept a period of being slower</p>
            <p>8. After every peak the first step is down </p>
            <p>9. Training + Rest + Nutrition = progress </p>
            <p>10. Hero weeks and hero sessions never work in the long term. If you can put together many months of
                doing just enough to improve you will make better progress. </p>
            <p>11. The best nutrition is the one that works for you – invest time in finding out rather than in trying
                the latest fad diet </p>
            <p>12. Endurance sports take time and so does the fitness required to complete them </p>
            <p>13. Mastery of a sport or skill is far more satisfying than just chasing times </p>
            <p>14. Define goals – from your ultimate performance on race day to the daily goals for getting it done </p>
            <p>15. Be resilient – life and races have setbacks. Things wont always go your way. In some sessions you
                will fly and most you will be at best, average. Stick at it </p>
            <p>16. Unless you are making a living from triathlon it’s more beneficial to have a holistic approach to
                health and fitness – try different activities, train across a wide range of intensities, become good at
                moving in multiple directions </p>
            <p>17. Sleep is your best recovery tool and its FREE. Find ways to get more not less. If you are going to
                spend money on recovery, invest in getting better sleep rather than inflatable leggings</p>
            <p>18. Three training zones are all you need – easy, moderate, hard </p>
            <p>19. Getting ALL of the basics right comes before precision in a couple of areas </p>
            <p>20. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health.</p>
