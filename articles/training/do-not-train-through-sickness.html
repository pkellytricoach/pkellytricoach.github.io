            <h4 class="mb-5">Do not train through sickness</h4>
            <p>This page is appropriate timing for me as I picked up a pretty nasty tummy bug that has me wiped. I
                haven’t training since yesterday morning. Should really have avoided my swim yesterday as I woke up
                feeling pretty crap and my HR was 10+ beats higher from my HRV reading. I still swam. I didn’t do my
                planned set. I did a super easy session. I woke up today feeling much worse. I learned my mistake from
                yesterday and training was definitely a no no. I’ll use my HR readings from HRV to determine if I will
                do an easy session tomorrow. If it is still super high, then I will leave it and try and rest as much as
                I can.</p>

            <p>Here are some rules:

            <p>If you’re sick or on the verge of becoming sick, immediately take a day off. Then
                see how you feel the following day and make the decision to train.</p>
            <p>When coming back to training, it is
                essential that you ease the body into the training. 2-3 days that would look like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Day 1 and 2: Short (30min maximum) light session of either cycling or swimming with some short light
                    efforts (10-20
                    seconds)
                </li>
                <li>Day 3: An easy short (30min) run and then another easy short (30min) session of swim or
                    bike. One of these sessions should have a few (3) short efforts of 15-30 seconds with full recovery
                    between to lightly stimulate the systems and get them back on track.If you do the efforts on the
                    bike,
                    choose your biggest gear, in the swim use paddles.
                </li>
                <li>During this easing back in process, and these light
                    sessions cause a higher heart rate than normal it simply means you have not recovered enough. Quit
                    the session.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>I understand you may be highly driven to get back into training but doing so too quickly will see both
                your performance (consistency) and health suffer. You could potentially lose 1-2 weeks fitness if your
                train through it. Play it smart and don’t gamble with your health.</p>

            <p>Another reason to re-learn to listen what your body is telling you.</p>
