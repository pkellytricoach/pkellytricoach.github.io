            <p>Alex Ferguson quote:</p>

            <p>“…good coaching relies on repetition. Forget all the nonsense about altering training programmes to keep players happy. The argument that they must be stimulated by constant variety may come across as progressive and enlightened but it is a dangerous evasion of priorities. In any physical activity, effective practice requires repeated execution of the skill involved… (there is a) need to concentrate on refining technique to the point where difficult skills become a matter of habit. When footballers complain about the dullness of repetitive passing exercises it is usually not monotony they resent, but hard work.”</p>

            <p>It’s like we have got to increase our stroke rate, our HR is higher. It’s hard work. But I have got to try and increase that stroke rate while keeping my stroke together. And unfortunately our pace may slow down to be able to hold the stroke rate. Or similarly when we are practicing running stride rate. Our HR might be through the roof while we are running at an easy pace. But eventually, the neuromuscular system takes over and you don’t have to think about it. It becomes an unconscious habit and creates performance. But first it’s hard work! It comes down to what? Training skills + repetition.</p>

            <p>There are lots of other reasons for repetition:</p>

            <p>Used as a benchmark. like calibration – last week your felt great, this week not so. Why not? You can compare to previous week. If sessions are constantly changing, you have no comparison point. If your session didn’t go to plan, why not? If last weeks was good, what was the difference this week? Sleep, stress, nutrition, attitude? These are monotonous sessions. It may seem like the coach is being lazy prescribing pretty much the same workout each week. It’s not. We’re not. We are benchmarking, plus we are also practicing skills and training focus. If you can’t hold focus for 3 mins, how do you do so for 3-4 hours. These are repeated workout sessions that focus on form, as opposed to aerobic levels of effort, encourage triathletes to develop more focus and concentration. With repetitions, athletes don’t need to undergo physiological testing (Everyone loves an FTP test right???) or worry about testing themselves over various race distances in training. Instead, repetition in training ensures that they can track their improvements in each sport every week. Accurately gauge fatigue, repeated patterns in training help the athlete determine if, on “one of those days,” they are truly tired and need rest or are merely having an “off” day.</p>
