            <h4 class="mb-5">Triathlon is not 3 sports! It&rsquo;s one sport &ndash; SWIMBIKERUN</h4>
            <p>When training for triathlon, athletes usually make the mistake of seeing it as 3 different sports. They
                assume they need to train for swimming like swimmers, bike like cyclists and run like runners. Instead
                they should be looking to save energy on the swim, reducing aerobic taxing and neuromuscular firing on
                the bike and teaching your body how to run on fatigued legs on tight muscles and reduced range of
                motion.</p>


            <p><h6>Swimming for triathlon</h6></p>

            <p>The average triathlete swims around 2-3 times a week &ndash; roughly 1.5k to 2k. This swim training
                volume does not give the athlete, enough time in the water to fully develop the skills as a swimmer.</p>

            <p> Unskilled swimmers uses way more energy to cover the same distance as a skilled
                swimmer, therefore they need to swim LESS volume but more frequently. Unskilled swimmers should not swim
                longer sets (3 x 500m) until they develop their skills. Swimming longer sets will not be as productive
                to the unskilled athlete as their stroke will fall apart after 100m or so. Doing lots of 25s and 50s
                with short recoveries are ideal with the correct form and under load. Unskilled swimmers should use
                equipment like pull buoy and
                paddles to aid with body position and to reduce aerobic taxing, also they help the athlete to develop a
                better stroke. Make sure when swimming with pull buoy that you DO NOT slow your stroke rate and/or glide
                as it will be detriment to your stroke development. The worse your body position, the higher you want
                your stroke rate to be.</p>
            <p>Small paddles develop strength endurance without slowing down your cadence too much. It also caps your
                heart rate allowing you to swim longer and build the strength required for long distance triathlon.</p>

            <p><h6>Cycling for triathlon</h6></p>

            <p>Cycling is the least skilled sport of all three and for triathlon it is more about strength than skills.
                The focus for cycling is about developing strength and lactate tolerance. Most age group athletes have
                limited time to train on the bike, usually 2 or 3 times per week, so it&rsquo;s important to make each
                session count! In triathlon, the bike is all about arriving at the start of the run in control, without
                having accumulated overt amounts of aerobic fatigue, having worked the legs in a way that accommodates
                cycling fatigue without generating run fatigue. It is from this &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tax the run muscles&rdquo;
                perspective that you can best understand how triathlon cycling is not the same as the sport of
                cycling.</p>

            <p>Riding with a higher cadence comes at a higher aerobic cost and greater glycogen consumption. As a
                triathlete, you are training to run after the cycling portion. A triathlete needs to increase running
                stride rate to preserve the run muscles.
                For 70.3 / Ironman, the cadence should be around 70-80 rpm. If you ride at a lower cadence during a
                triathlon, you will not fatigue your
                neuromuscular system as much (each rpm requires a muscle firing command by your neuromuscular system),
                saving it for when it is needed most! At the end of an ironman run where we want to keep that 180+
                cadence.</p>

            <p>Lower cadence cycling: &ndash; Saves neuromuscular system (&ldquo;Firing&rdquo;) to be used on the run
                &ndash; Lowers heart rate due to the slow contractions and high resistance &ndash; Consequently
                conserves glycogen stores important fuel need on any endurance event</p>

            <p><h6>Running for triathlon</h6></p>

            <p>Running in triathlon is totally different than road racing. Athletes have, in their legs, a limited
                range of motion that is caused by tight and overused muscles (the hip flexors, hamstrings, quads, etc).
                3+ hours on the bike will do that to you! This limited range of motion will prevent you from bringing
                your legs as high during the recovery phase
                and from bringing your knee as high during the propulsion phase. Therefore, the stride length gets
                shorter and you&rsquo;ll run slower.</p>

            <p>Efficiency in triathlon running comes from the ability to run fast on tired and tight legs. To
                be able to do this, you need to develop a running style that is more like &ldquo;shuffle running&rdquo;.
                Not pretty but effective. We focus on a higher turnover to overcome the shortening in your stride.</p>

            <p>High cadence running becomes even more important during long distance races like the Ironman, in which
                the distance will add an extra level of fatigue on your legs, thereby reducing your stride length even
                more. By running with a lower stride rate, your second half of the marathon will be much slower or even
                turn to a walk. Remember the longer the time you spend on the ground (lower stride rate) the higher is
                the muscle fatigue.</p>

            <p>A lot of practice and PATIENCE is needed to develop a high stride rate running style as your body at
                first is not used
                to the new neuromuscular pattern of firing your muscles so quickly. Also running at a high stride rate
                will increase your heart rate initially. In time however, it will be the new normal. I consider run
                cadence to be one of the most important metrics.</p>

            <p>In summary:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Swim: Focus on developing strength in the water. The more you train this way, the more prepared you&rsquo;ll
                    be to race fast in open water swims.
                </li>
                <li>Bike: Low cadence cycling means lower heart rate and higher efficiency. Practice big gear riding to
                    get you ready for race day.
                </li>
                <li>Run: High stride rate running leads to less fatigued legs and more efficient triathlon running.</li>
            </ul>
