            <p>70.3 / Ironman and most ultra endurance endevours are strength-endurance sports. </p>

            <p>Came across this ‘Without strength speed cannot be accomplished. Strength determines the rate of force development (RFD) meaning how fast your muscles contracts to produce a maximal amount of force. With minimal strength there is low RFD meaning that the muscles in your body will not be able to get you to the finish before the guy that can produce the same amount of force in a shorter period of time.’ </p>

            <p>People can lose natural speed and strength because they train it out of the body. 70.3 / Ironman and ultra running... are strength-endurance sports. Without great muscle fibre recruitment and the ability for fibres to forcefully contract REPEATEDLY for the long haul you greatly diminish ability and thus 'speed'. </p>

            <p>What we are trying to maintain is build and maintain our strength and thus increase natural speed. When we do this right, endurance happens as a by product of this. 70.3/Ironman is the ability to endure. Muscles/systems ability to endure over a long period of time (9/10 hours). Being strong in the backend of the race is key.</p>
            <p>Remember the fastest person is the one who slows down the least.</p>
