            <p>The best way to lay a foundation of aerobic fitness is quite simple:
                Perform a gradually and steadily increasing amount of running at a comfortable pace. Start by running
                every other day. Do one “long run” per week on Saturday or Sunday. We do a test run progression.
                Beginning with 60 mins and adding 10 mins The goal is to track the joint pain level and muscle recovery.
                If an athlete runs for 90 min and has sore joints for 3 days, then the volume of running is too much for
                that particular athlete current ability right now. We will increase this to 2 hours. Anything over two
                hours you reach the point of diminishing returns, where return on effort is reduced. Chances of injury
                increases as form deteriorates. Particularly with older athletes, it’s important to favour run frequency
                over volume.</p>

            <p>What are neuromuscular sessions and how do we incorporate them?</p>

            <p>The main goal of strides/pick ups in our workouts is to improve your running economy and efficiency. In
                layman’s terms, this means being able to run faster and farther with less effort and while expending
                less energy. For a marathoner or half marathoner, this means race pace will require less effort (making
                it feel easier, especially in the latter miles) and you’ll be able to conserve precious carbohydrates in
                the process. Strides in your workouts train the body to activate a greater percentage of muscle fibers
                with each stride. In doing so, you’re able to make each stride more explosive and generate more power
                without increasing effort. This increased power is what makes your stride more fluid and allows you to
                propel yourself farther with each stride, making you faster.</p>

            <p>In addition, strides improves the efficiency of the neuromuscular system, which is the communication
                system between your brain and your muscles. Improving the efficiency of the neuromuscular system allows
                your body to increase the speed at which it sends signals to the muscles and, more importantly,
                contributes to the activation of a greater percentage of muscle fibers.</p>

            <p>If the best way to build a foundation of aerobic fitness is to go long and slow, the best way to build a
                foundation of neuromuscular fitness is to do very short, very fast efforts such as speed intervals (e.g.
                6 x 300-meter relaxed sprints a track), fartlek intervals (30-60-second hard efforts sprinkled
                throughout an otherwise easy run) and steep hill sprints. These short sessions are not too taxing
                aerobically and the efforts are short that you can recover really quickly, they are typically placed at
                the end of an easy run. There are a number reasons for this, first they flush out the legs so they are
                primed for the following session and two, the previous 50 minutes or so fatigue you enough that you do
                not push too hard or long in the intervals. They act as insurance against going too hard. They also
                increase the power and efficiency of the stride, enabling you to cover more ground with each stride with
                less energy in race circumstances. These are significant benefits from a training method that takes very
                little time and is fun to do. And lastly, they target two key areas of run improvements – economy (hill
                sprints) and speed (strides).</p>
