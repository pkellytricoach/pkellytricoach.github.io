            <p>Me and one of our athletes are training for Ironman Lanzarote in 9-10 weeks. </p>

            <p>I used to dread racing in the heat. My first two attempts at ironman were in France where I was faced
                with two 36+ degree days. Not ideal for this pasty white irish fella. Everything crumbled on the day, it
                became about survival. I thought it was just me, but really heat effects everyone. And if you are intent
                with doing Ironman and in particular racing in nice locations, then you really need to start embracing
                the heat as most tend to be hot locations.</p>

            <p>Benefits include - Blood plasma volume expansion which reduces cardio strain. Lay person, more blood
                plasma = more cardiovascular fitness. - Get an increased rate of perspiration which is good as it keeps
                body cooling - Reduce overall core temperature</p>

            <p>So I needed to learn how to adapt to heat. After conversations with my coach and various notes from
                podcasts (Found my fitness, Fitter), here is the approach I went for</p>

            <p>- Heat adaptation benefits accrue quickly, but also wear off quickly. In general, it takes around two to
                three weeks to get most adaptations, so 2.5 weeks out, schedule a full week or 7 days of sauna use. Then
                for the next week, every other day. - Have approx 10 sessions in a sauna. 2.5 weeks out, schedule 5
                sessions in a row. Studies have found this amount enough to cause adaptations. In race week, schedule 2
                sessions early in the week. No sauna 2-3 days before departing for race. Decay of adaptations happen
                more slowly. - Sauna time should be roughly 20-30 mins (wear a HR monitor as this is quite stressful on
                the body). Do the sauna work immediately after a session where core temperature is elevated. Exercise
                bike or treadmill in a gym. - Do not use water during session and sauna or for about 2 hours after. This
                is called thermo-tolerance. - Recommend taking probiotics/zinc/vit c during this time. - Stacy sims
                reckon you need to get the gut in shape. Heat stress can get the gut pretty leaky. So good probiotics.
                No NSAIDs, they excaborate the leaky gut. Tumeric is good for inflammation. 5g at glutamine per day at
                night helps the gut. </p>

            <p>Also, during the heat, if the race provides ice at the aid stations, I found it very useful to hold ice
                in my hand from aid station to aid station as a means of keeping core temperature cool.</p>

            <p>There you have it. </p>
