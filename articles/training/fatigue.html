            <p>All fatigue is not created equal Dealing with fatigue</p>

            <p>Ok, so what happens if we are constantly tired or our training program is consistently interrupted with
                illness, injury. Assuming we are getting adequate sleep, great nutrition and good recovery then its most
                likely a training program that doesn’t integrate into your life.</p>

            <p>It seems to be a given that in 70.3/ironman training, you should always be in a fatigued state, normalising
                it. I’ve experienced this myself. This shouldn’t be the case. Most likely related to too many tough
                intervals or too much volume.</p>

            <p>It’s important to note that there are two types of fatigue we experience. We have ‘deep fatigue’ and
                ‘shallow fatigue’.</p>

            <p>Deep fatigue</p>

            <p>When you trash an aerobic system with too much volume, or work at threshold/tempo. This is catabolic, it
                breaks the body down creating deeper fatigue. It can screw your endocrine/hormonal balance and take
                weeks to recover from. It plays havoc with Cortisol.This is the primary stress hormone that is the
                antagonist of testosterone, the primary vitality and anti-aging hormone. When cortisol is elevated,
                testosterone is suppressed. This delays recovery, accelerates the aging process, promotes the
                catabolization of lean muscle tissue, and even causes declines in cognitive function.</p>

            <p>Shallow fatigue</p>

            <p>Strength and Neuromuscular work creates shallow fatigue. It’s less severe and results in much quicker
                recovery. It only creates a small shift in endocrine balance. It’s anabolic. It builds the body up as
                opposed to catabolic. It improves our recovery. It stimulates a spike in testosterone and human growth
                hormone. Because they are over with quickly, they carry little risk of the catabolic effects of pure
                endurance work. How does this work? When you perform an intense strength session, micro-tears occur in
                the proteins that control the muscles’ contraction. The damaged muscle sends a message to the brain that
                it needs some extra protein to heal the tears and rebuild itself even stronger in order to withstand a
                similar future assault. To supervise the rebuilding, the body dispatches an army of hormones, including
                the fountain-of-youth dynamic duo, human growth hormone and testosterone. Growth hormone, responsible
                for growing young bodies to adult size, helps glue adults’ torn muscles back together and promotes
                youthful vitality at any age by regenerating muscle mass, bone, cartilage, hair, nails, and skin,
                stimulating deeper sleep, and even reducing body fat. Testosterone influences energy, motivation, mental
                focus, and libido, and also plays a critical role in recovery and the maintenance of an athletic body
                composition (promoting lean muscle mass and turbo-charging fat burning). These so-called “adaptive”
                hormones are released in large doses during all forms of strength/intense exercise. These hormones also
                decline with age—steadily in a best-case scenario. For athletes over thirty-five, stimulating pulses of
                these important hormones through intense exercise can deliver a potent anti-aging, performance-enhancing
                effect. Again, the sustained low-to-medium-intensity cardiovascular workouts that are your bread and
                butter provide an assortment of health benefits and disease protection, but they simply do not deliver a
                similar hormonal fountain-of-youth effect that brief, intense sessions do. In fact, they quite often
                deliver the opposite effect—a suppression of adaptive hormones when you drift into a chronic pattern.
                This is why even the emaciated Tour de France riders favor the same anabolic steroids that hulking
                bodybuilders and home run hitters use.</p>

            <p>If we know and follow the above, how do we place this in a training week?</p>

            <p>We could have a big aerobic load on the weekend depending on the phase of training you are in. This is
                catabolic by nature. This may have involved a 3 hour ride on Saturday, and a 90 min run on Sunday with a
                lot of aerobic emphasis on it. That means we may be aerobically taxed come Monday (catabolic – it’s has
                created deeper fatigue). Monday is a good time to throw in some strength specific work in – anabolic,
                build our body back up and help with recovery. An example of this could be 20 x 1 min on/off at a really
                low cadence, or some pull/paddle/bands work in the pool. This helps us recover from aerobic work. You
                might enter that strength session with a mindset of ‘god, I’m wrecked, How am I going to through this
                session’. However, you can do this as fatigue is not created equal, and you will most likely feel better
                for it after.</p>

            <p>How do we monitor fatigue on a daily basis?</p>

            <p>TSS/TSB in TP is ok. Useful, to monitor and track your overall training stress. Useful to at least start
                a conversation. However, it doesn’t take into considering life stress. As a busy time starved athlete,
                you have to be very careful to gauge fatigue purely off the data you have been provided. None of the
                data gives you a wonderful sense of the interaction between life stress and training stress. HRV and
                morning HR which we are all using can help us here. Also observing our objective and subjective states
                .</p>

            <p>Here are some objective markers to monitor fatigue:</p>

            <p>Morning HR lower than normal</p>

            <p>Wake up in the morning and you have a very suppressed in heart rate. Not necessarily a big jump in
                fitness, but it could be an accumulation of fatigue.</p>

            <p>Morning HR lower than normal</p>

            <p>Also, if it’s a little higher than normal. Could be also fatigue, but more acute in nature.</p>

            <p>Night sweats</p>

            <p>If you go to bed at night, and you are waking up with night sweats. At night your core temp should drop
                at night. You should cool. If it is in overdrive and very hot, that is hormonal stress. Your body is
                fatigued.</p>

            <p>Highly fatigued during day</p>

            <p>At work feeling sleepy, than when you try to go to bed at night but are awake and alert. Another
                objective indicator of hormonal stress.</p>

            <p>Chronic underperformance of days/weeks.</p>

            <p>RPE higher for lower effort. Seems harder RPE, but power is not that high. Big marker that you are
                accumulating too much fatigue.</p>

            <p>Big changes in body composition or weight.</p>

            <p>Either losing or gaining a lot of body weight. If that’s happening dramatically than often another
                indicator</p>

            <p>Subjective markers</p>

            <p>Drop in motivation Lack of focus / concentration Inability to make smart decisions throughout work day.
                Typically a higher RPE across all sessions. Overall lack of enjoyment.</p>

            <p>Again, a lot of these can be linked to accumulated fatigue.</p>

            <p>How do we make smart decisions?</p>

            <p>Do I push through or back off?</p>

            <p>Anticipated fatigue</p>

            <p>A lot of our long bikes have harder sections at the end to mimic the end of our bike leg when your body
                is starting to fatigue. These interval are anticipated fatigue. We definitely need to push through these
                sessions. We are not looking for breakthrough power etc. Mission is to ride or run with good habits
                under fatigue. We are looking to create durability and resilience and build mental toughness to endure
                when we don’t want too (Daragh experienced this and pushed through last weekend). Fatigue is a part of
                training. You must maximise performance in a fatigued state. Or holding good ironman marathon form under
                duress. So we are ready on race day.</p>

            <p>For our non A races, we are never going to be fully tapered, so always carrying fatigue into them. This
                acts as an insurance policy so not to generate too much fatigue from the lower key race so you recover
                faster and can get back to normal training.</p>

            <p>When do we back off?</p>

            <p>Make a wise decision to backoff, without guilt, fear or worry that you are not following the program.</p>

            <p>Life has been really hectic, your 10 days into a 14 day block of training. Life has just got in the way.
                It is provided extra stress. Sleep hasn’t been great. Getting ‘on-call’ calls throughout the night. Or
                you moved house (In Alans case). The last 2 sessions have been really really hard relative to
                expectations. You fought through them, but if you really took a step back, the performance wasn’t great
                in them. Now today, you are faced with a tough interval session. You feel like you can barely keep your
                eyes open, let alone lift yourself to a great performance. What do you do? You still give yourself a
                shot. You see what the body gives you. You test drive the body. You do the warmup, sometimes perception
                of fatigue is better than the actuality, so better to give yourself a shot. And maybe the body will warm
                up. So after warm up, you are at the cross road – the main set. If you start to feel good, do the
                intervals. Finish the workout. But most likely the chances are you began the session with too much
                accumulated fatigue. So if you do follow through with the workout, then you should give yourself a
                little protocol of recovery, adjust the session. Make it recovery in nature. Dial the effort right down
                without any guilt. What if even during the warm up your RPE is really high? Then quit. Don’t feel bad
                about the red or orange box in Training peaks. Your body will thank you for it.</p>

            <p>When do you get back to it?</p>

            <p>If it’s the last scenario, then take 2-3 days of very very easy training. Move blood around the body with
                light activity. We are not looking to get fitter, more powerful. Instead we are trying to rejuvenate.
                Focus on good sleep, fuel + hydration and most importantly, avoid guilt. It’s being smart! We want to
                get to the bottom of what caused the stress? Life stress, work stress, training stress? Once we get
                through this rejuvenation period, the system will hopefully bounce back. How do we ramp back in to
                normal training. We follow a getting back to training protocol similar to described here .</p>
