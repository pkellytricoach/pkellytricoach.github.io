            <p>The training intensity levels described below are structured by how you feel on any given day. This
                teaches you to use intuition and understand your body, ensuring you ease into your program and do not go
                too hard to start!</p>

            <p>In addition to looking after your body from the start, focusing on truly easy development will allow you
                to improve your fat adaptation, building a more robust and resilient system and increasing your
                metabolic flexibility. The end result from that is that you will become a far more efficient athlete.
                BUT this takes time and patience and will not happen if you rush the Easy and suppress your metabolic
                flexibility.</p>

            <p>I used to be very much data driven. That‚Äôs not to say I‚Äôm not any more, I still look (and love) looking
                at data, but I‚Äôm trying not to be a slave to it. Previously everything was driven by TSS/CTL/FTP,4
                min/k‚Äôs. You get my drift, needing to have a certain CTL going into a race. But ultimately these are
                just mathematical models dreamt up by training peaks, and do not take into consideration life stresses.
                Prescriptive training like this where each session has to be in Zone 3a or between 77-81% of FTP can end
                up with the athlete feeling very demoralised or unmotivated if he is not hitting that target. Each day
                when we show up, we don‚Äôt know what our body is going to give us. We may be carrying a lot more fatigue
                from previous sessions or had a crap night sleep, fight with partner etc. Because of this we can‚Äôt
                expect our performance to be linear and always improving. That each session should be better than the
                last.</p>

            <p>Here is an excellent article on the topic</p>

            <p>Basic summary is this, say you go out for your run and it‚Äôs awesome. You feel fast and fluid and you have
                your GPS watch on but have decided not to look at it and leave it for a post-run analysis. Now you
                finish the run and are feeling great only for it to come crashing down when you see your fast wasn‚Äôt
                that fast, or wasn‚Äôt what it ‚Äòshould‚Äô be‚Ä¶ now the run was shit. You get beaten up psychologically and it
                DOES effect things going forward. Now just imagine if you didn‚Äôt have the fancy watch? The run would
                have still been awesome. This would be a massive psychological boon to future you and performance.</p>

            <p>As the article says, the body sees stress and not miles. All stressors add up. And when we beat ourselves
                up (a stressor) because what our watch says. We end up hurting ourselves. The watches and power-meters
                are great, but can hurt us also. I know of examples with myself, Matt and Jack last year. I had about
                3-4 weeks where I just couldn‚Äôt hit any numbers in training. I did a good FTP test, my training from
                then revolved around this FTP number. However, I wasn‚Äôt able for the training load and was worn out. My
                coach (Plews) at the time, dialled it right down ‚Äì almost 30w. My confidence took a real hit. Similar
                with Matt, was really pissed with some predicted bike power for Ironman because his FTP was much higher.
                So his IM pace ‚ÄòSHOULD‚Äô be 240/260. Grant Giles said ‚ÄòFTP is something you use as a guide to use on the
                road to find out what is real‚Äô. Jack jumped out of some swim sessions early because his 100s ‚ÄòSHOULD‚Äô
                have been faster, got pissed off and jumped out.</p>

            <p>To finish before we list the training intensities, on race day your body is going to be as fresh as it
                has been all year. The body is never fully recovered (at least it shouldn‚Äôt it be) during training; so
                don‚Äôt allow a gadget to dictate your ability when you are fully tapered for an Ironman/70.3. Cascais
                this year really thought me that. I literally had cadence+pace on my screen during the run split ‚Äì I
                keep pace as I sometimes drift away in my thoughts, lose focus and slow down. I didn‚Äôt like what HR was
                telling me, so I switched it off üôÇ I was feeling fine. So here‚Äôs the take, If you are always running
                based on feel does it actually matter what the heart rate is doing? If you aren‚Äôt feeling 100% (which
                happens from time to time in ironman) and you looked are HR and it was low it wouldn‚Äôt do you any
                favours to push harder because you thought your HR should be higher, or vice versa, if it was high, but
                you felt really comfortable at that time, should you slow down? Will this ultimately sabotage race
                performance and your best race outcome? The body will tell you all you need to know in order to set the
                pace.</p>

            <p>The training levels below are designed to be simple to understand and implement. Also, they teach us to
                listen to what our body is giving us that day. If it says HARD, are we really giving it all we got? If
                it says EASY, is the effort truly easy?</p>

            <p>Learning your pacing takes time to truly develop but you must put the work in from day one. With the
                amount of gadgetry and computer feedback available to you, we can get lazy and let our devices prescribe
                the intensity. Every session, continually ask yourself: ‚ÄúIs this effort true?‚Äù. This continual systems
                check, rehearsed each session, will enable you race to your true ability and finish strong. Be honest
                with your efforts and everything will fall into place.</p>

            <p>Easy</p>

            <p>Comfortable, conversational pace. In the swim relaxed strokes. On the bike, easy relaxed cadence. On the
                run, easy jog with a nice rhythm. In general, a sustainable, "all day" pace. Many athletes underestimate
                this level and typically start at a pace that may feel easy but could not in
                all honesty be sustained for a long period of time, ie. could you hold this starting pace for hours and
                hours. Easy not only provides developing aerobic capacity correctly, it ensures we have the ability
                later on in the session to push and this is where the real training effect occurs! In FTP terms this is
                under 55-60% (ahem, we are not slave to this, so if 55% feels a little too hard, then dial it down with
                absolutely no guilt!), RPE 2-3 out of 10. This is the training zone most athletes struggle to buy into.
                We‚Äôve been conditioned to believe that faster is always better and to go faster ‚Ä¶ we need to run fast,
                swim faster and bike faster. Bullshitting yourself on your easy limits how fast you can potentially go.
                For instance, easy running is indispensable for long-term speed development. It enhances capillary
                development and aerobic enzyme activity. It also increases your running economy, reducing the amount of
                energy it takes to go a given pace. I know I struggled with this zone. I tend to keep it around
                50-55%</p>

            <p>Moderate</p>

            <p>A moderate effort means that you need to start pushing a bit. This is a pace that starts to harness some
                strength in your swim stroke, your pedal stroke or your stride, but it doesn't feel hard.
                The effort / pace is sustainable for long efforts. In the swim, you swim without pushing your aerobic
                system to strain. Breathing should be light enough that you recover for another effort within 10
                seconds. On the bike, a pace you can sustain for many hours. On the run, you are "feeling your oats" and
                stepping out of warm-up pace. You could comfortably run this for several hours. It‚Äôs not hard but if you
                held this pace for a sustained amount of time by virtue of the volume your perceived effort will shift
                towards mod-hard to hard. You should feel some strength in all swim, bike
                and running but all in all it should feel like a good pace with controlled breathing and efforts that
                are easy to recover from. Using your scale, you should be around 4-5/10 and nor more than that. It does
                take time to develop this intuition, but if you feel you are above 5/10, you need to dial it back to
                maintain a truly Moderate pace. Your breathing rate should be balanced, with no forced inhalations or
                rushing exhalation, your body relaxed and in control.</p>

            <p>You may even see cardiac drift towards the end of this workout. (Cardiac drift is where your Heart Rate
                naturally begins to rise as a result of the duration of the exercise and possibly environmental factors
                such as heat.) You should be able to hold a conversation for the duration of this workout.</p>

            <p>Typically around 55-70% of FTP</p>

            <p>Mod-Hard</p>

            <p>This is really the ‚Äòmeat & potatoes‚Äô of your training intensity. This feels like the effort you would
                race your long race when fit. This is typically termed Zone 3 or grey zone training which everyone says
                avoid. However, it‚Äôs
                race pace, so should be practiced. This will be used a lot as we approach our race day in the last 8-9
                weeks. Too much time in this intensity can lead to accumulated fatigue and stress. It‚Äôs our race pace.
                It‚Äôs not a pace that really hurts but it‚Äôs not exactly pain free either. Focus becomes critically
                important to keep form and pace maximised. It‚Äôs a pace you can hold, but you couldn‚Äôt push much harder
                without having to back off again. You can sustain this pace for the foreseeable time, but your breathing
                is somewhat labored and conversation is definitely curtailed. You need to focus on the effort but are
                not pushing a pace where you need to back off ‚Äì nor do you feel like you would want to push it much
                faster, either.
            </p>

            <p>Look for a 6-7/10 here but be honest in your assessment. Most athletes will trick themselves into
                thinking that they are pushing mod-hard but are actually going well above that level. This needs to be
                comfortably uncomfortable; sustainable to a point. Your breathing will be laboured, but no gasping but
                it is important that you focus on body position and form here as this is a critical aspect of sustaining
                this intensity.</p>

            <p>Typically around 75%-90% of FTP</p>

            <p>Hard</p>

            <p>This is an effort that is uncomfortable. Period. We place these efforts in specific amounts i.e. short or
                specific efforts or as longer sustained efforts at the back end of our aerobic (easy) sessions. This way
                we can push HARD and get the desired training effect without compromising our ability to recover or push
                so hard that we harm our muscular and aerobic systems. This is because we have developed some good
                fatigue from the 3 hours easy prior to this (insurance policy). You will be breathing hard but you have
                a little extra to give if required. The pace definitely hurts but you can sustain it for the advised
                periods. This is typically a very precise 8/10 and your body should be giving you distinct feedback
                here, which makes focusing on form even more important.</p>

            <p>Typically around 90%-105% of FTP</p>

            <p>Fast</p>

            <p>This effort is quite uncomfortable. In training we only typically do short repeats of this fast work so
                we drip in the stimulus rather than a big hammer blow. This intensity could be TT or a 10k run pace
                effort or simply 9/10. Your breathing will be forceful and ultimately not very sustainable. You will be
                receiving sting feedback from the body as you push to your ‚Äì almost ‚Äì absolute threshold.</p>

            <p>Typically greater than 105% FTP</p>
