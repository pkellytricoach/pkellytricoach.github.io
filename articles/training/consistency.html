            <p>Consistency We all know consistency is key in our sport (or any endurance endeavour). The more consistent
                you are, the smarter (and harder) you train your body and mind, the further you go.</p>

            <p>If being consistent was easy, everyone would be winning races and or performing well but being consistent
                is NOT easy.</p>

            <p>Tips for helping consistency:</p>

            <p>Play the long game</p>

            <p>The unfortunate reality is that many athletes don’t stay the course long enough to realise the benefits,
                and have a training history littered with holes – This will result in detraining, losing not only the
                physiological benefits but also the skills learned during the season. It’s like two steps forward, one
                step back. So when you get back, you have to basically start all over again losing all you have gained
                during the season. The time-course-for-adaptations, or at least the one’s that really matter in terms of
                optimising your potential, is typically much longer than most will ever acknowledge and understand.
                David Roche wants his athletes to have a 10 year plan. Yes, you read that right, 10 years! Be the Warren
                Buffet of training and hold a long term view.</p>

            <p>Consistent Beats Epic Because Epic Is Not Consistent</p>

            <p>Quit looking for the knockout punches in every sessions. You miss a few sessions during the week, you try
                to make up for it with a 170km bike ride at the weekend when unfit or without the foundations of
                strength and motor skills required. Similar with the long run. Or adding an extra 2-3 intervals to your
                speed session or training with someone who is at a different level to you right now. What will happen
                tomorrow when you try to train? Boy, that session wiped me yesterday..need to rest today. No way I can
                possibly train. Consistency gone.</p>

            <p>Stay Injury Free</p>

            <p>Keeping up your daily mobility work and rolling. Doing daily soft tissue work is much more time efficient
                and put an end to overuse injuries (mostly avoidable – and very unlikely to be that one run), the
                problem typically slowly builds until its too late. We build that phone book one page at a time, before
                you become unrippable. Building resilience</p>

            <p>Love the process</p>

            <p>If you want to become the best athlete you can be, you have to love the process. Your training is a ‘want
                to’ not a ‘have to’. Any endurance endeavour, you need to play the long game. There are no shortcuts.
                You have to have a long view. To eek out your potential, the simple requirement is long term
                consistency. If you don’t love the process, consistency is not going to happen. You don’t have to go to
                the well each week. Certain blocks in years, but certainly on a daily basis you need to be training.</p>

            <p>Establish a healthy environment</p>

            <p>We need a system that we can apply year on year with minimal break (typically 2 weeks for off-season,
                then back at 45-60 min sessions daily for a period before building again). For this to happen, we are
                looking for an environment where work, family, emotional, stress, training, nutrition, sleep and of
                course fun are well balanced. If you’re tired constantly and don’t have energy for your spouse/partner
                kids etc, then this is not a healthy environment. Missing out on family events or spending precious time
                with kids because of training, this is not a healthy environment. If all you can give is 8-9 hours
                consistently year round to maintain a healthy balance at home and work, then so be it. It may take a bit
                longer but we will get there by keeping our consistency as opposed to trying to commit to 15 hours where
                you are burning the candle at both ends and eventually burnout, fall out of love with the process and
                give up.</p>

            <p>Have great big audacious goals!</p>

            <p>Know your why? What are your deep motivations? I’d be lying if I said Kona isn’t a HUGE motivation for
                me. Ultimately, this is what drives me, and gets me out of bed each morning. There are so many other
                events I want to do. But for now, I need to focus on this. However, I will also be very conscious of
                enjoying every minute of the journey and not beating myself up if I don’t achieve it in a certain time.
                If it takes 10 years, so be it. I have belief that I will get there, it’s just a matter of when.</p>

            <p>There you have it. Adopt a mindset where your most important measuring stick is training consistency. Not
                the distance of your long rides or runs. Not the pace or power of your hard intervals.</p>

            <p>Instead of setting numeric goals for your next season, what about setting consistency goals?</p>

            <p>For example, if your training program has 10 workouts a week, that is 560 workouts a year so maybe you
                can set a goal of doing 500 workouts that would give you 60 workouts to miss (for some that’s 30 days
                for others even more). This goal setting method, by consistency, will help you to achieve your goals and
                dreams much easily than setting up times for your race finishes or workouts. The consistency and hard
                work will get you fit and the numbers you want to achieve….will be the consequence.</p>

            <p>Remember that no brick is too small when building up your training wall. A few laps around the block are
                enough on the most stressful days. Set up a framework for consistency, and don’t let the desire for
                perfect training get in the way of good-enough training.</p>

            <p>To finish off, I got this amazing snippet from a James Clear newsletter referencing the Seinfeld
                strategy. </p>

            <p>According to Forbes magazine, Seinfeld reached his peak in earnings when he made $267 million dollars in
                1998. (A full 10 years later, in 2008, Seinfeld was still pulling in a cool $85 million per year.
                However, what is most impressive about Seinfeld's career isn't the awards, the earnings, or the special
                moments — it's the remarkable consistency of it all. Show after show, year after year, he performs,
                creates, and entertains at an incredibly high standard. Jerry Seinfeld produces with a level of
                consistency that most of us wish we could bring to our daily lives.</p>

            <p> The “Seinfeld Strategy” Brad Isaac was a young comedian starting out on the comedy circuit. One fateful
                night, he found himself in a club where Jerry Seinfeld was performing. In an interview on Lifehacker,
                Isaac shared what happened when he caught Seinfeld backstage and asked if he had “any tips for a young
                comic.”</p>

            <p>Here's how Isaac described the interaction with Seinfeld…</p>

            <p>He said the way to be a better comic was to create better jokes and the way to create better jokes was to
                write every day.</p>

            <p>He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall.
                The next step was to get a big red magic marker. He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I
                get to put a big red X over that day.</p>

            <p>“After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll
                like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job is to not
                break the chain.” [1]</p>

            <p>You'll notice that Seinfeld didn't say a single thing about results.</p>

            <p>It didn’t matter if he was motivated or not. It didn’t matter if he was writing great jokes or not. It
                didn't matter if what he was working on would ever make it into a show. All that mattered was “not
                breaking the chain.”</p>

            <p>And that's one of the simple secrets behind Seinfeld's remarkable productivity and consistency. For
                years, the comedian simply focused on “not breaking the chain.”</p>

            <p>The Seinfeld Strategy works because it helps to take the focus off of each individual performance (in our
                case workout) and puts the emphasis on the process instead. It’s not about how you feel, how inspired
                you are, or how brilliant your work is that day. </p>

            <p>It’s just about “not breaking the chain.”</p>

            <p>James Clear and Kristian Manietta wrote a great piece on this:</p>

            <p>"Most people need consistency more than they need intensity.</p>

            <p>Intensity: - run a marathon - write a book in 30 days - silent meditation retreats</p>

            <p>Consistency: - don't miss a workout in 2 years - write every week - daily meditation</p>

            <p>Intensity makes a good story. Consistency makes progress.</p>

            <p>Are you making progress? </p>

            <p>Real progress doesn't happen by an intense time frame. It comes imperceptibly over time. </p>

            <p>As I've said before it takes time to get good. Endurance sports require volume, which smartly can be
                built over time and thus allow your body to handle the load you impose upon it. Trying to 'hack' this
                process through intensity will leave you broken. In body and health. </p>

            <p>So be the consistent drip of water that changes stone over time. Not the big wall of water that just
                creates damage. </p>

            <p>Then when you need to focus on an 'intense' period of time, you'll be able to not only handle it but
                thrive from it. "</p>
