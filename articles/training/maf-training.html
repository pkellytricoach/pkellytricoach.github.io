            <p>MAF Training A lot of below is taken from https://philmaffetone.com/180-formula and some Simon Ward
                tips.</p>

            <p>What is MAF Training?</p>

            <p>The method developed by Dr Phil Maffetone is a slow and steady way to help improve a runner’s aerobic
                base by using heart rate to gauge the amount of stress on the body. This allow the runner to know what
                pace they should be running at, with the hopeful advantage of limiting stress on the body to help reduce
                the chance of injury. By limiting injury, we then see a more consistent approach to training with less
                interruptions.</p>

            <p>To work out your MAF heart rate, take 180 and minus your age. Depending on your level of fitness or if
                you are recovering from injury or illness, you can then adjust this number further. The adjustments are
                below:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>If you have or are recovering from a major illness (heart disease, any operation or hospital stay,
                    etc.) or are on any regular medication, subtract an additional 10
                </li>
                <li>If you are injured, have regressed in training or competition, get more than two colds or bouts of
                    flu per year, have allergies or asthma, or if you have been inconsistent or are just getting back
                    into training, subtract an additional 5
                </li>
                <li>If you have been training consistently (at least four times weekly) for up to two years without any
                    of the problems in (a) and (b), keep the number (180–age) the same
                </li>
                <li>If you have been training for more than two years without any of the problems in (a) and (b), and
                    have made progress in competition without injury, add 5
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p>So for me, I am 42, which gives me a 138, and because I have been training consistently for over two
                years, I could add 5. So my ceiling for most of my training is 135-40ish (we don’t get too
                molecular).</p>

            <p>You CAN go above your MAF HR – its just that staying below MAF will allow you to develop a good aerobic
                fitness with less fatigue</p>

            <p>MAF will develop aerobic metabolism perfectly well – Increased capillary density, blood volume and use of
                fatty acids as a fuel source. You get a strong training effect from training at 55-70% intensity. For
                longer sessions 55-65% will be OK, 65-75% for shorter sessions</p>

            <p>You don’t have to stick to MAF all the time, but if you do then you will get just as fit</p>

            <p>MAF is for training NOT racing (although it might work for some types of ultra endurance events). On race
                days JUST race!!</p>

            <p>MAF is not slow running. yes, it does start out like this because runners have inefficient technique at
                lower speeds and because they aerobic system isn’t truly developed. With time and patience you can
                actually run quite briskly at MAF HR’s.</p>

            <p>MAF works regardless of the mode of training</p>

            <p>MAF promotes efficient running (perfect for those training for a marathon, ironman or ultra run!)</p>

            <p>MAF doesn’t mean ONLY easy training. In fact Maffetone himself endorses high intensity intervals at the
                right time. What he discourages is the “kinda hard” running that so many of us engage in</p>

            <p>MAF training allows the accumulation of large volumes of work – Consistency is much better when using a
                MAF approach. Why? because cumulative fatigue ultimately leads to a compromised immune system or
                fatigued leg muscles (leading to adjusted running technique) and finally to illness or injury</p>

            <p>MAF can and will work for all athletes regardless of their level of competition. When it stops working
                one must look at everything in your life. Poor sleep, sub optimal nutrition, elevated stress are three
                of many reasons why it may not be working. Please don’t just blame the training</p>

            <p>MAF requires a long term approach and patience. You may see some improvements in a couple of weeks but
                the true benefits will occur when you have linked together several months of consistent training</p>
