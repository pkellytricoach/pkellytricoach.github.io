                Sleep and training go hand in hand. General aerobic exercise has been shown to counteract insomnia. Lots of research shows that exercise lowers stress levels and resting heart rate, allowing for better sleep. Training provides the stimulus, recovery provides the adaptations. Sleep is the best form of recovery. Training helps with better sleep. Great news for athlete’s, right? In theory yes. In practice however, many athletes suffer from sleep problems due to poor lifestyle habits, poor nutrition, and overtraining.

                We should be aiming for at least 7 hours sleep each night.
                lack of sleep will drive up insulin and cortisol levels and create a hormonal environment that is unfavourable for fat loss.
                If you don’t get enough shut-eye, appetite-stimulating hormones such as ghrelin ramp up, causing strong cravings for sugar, sweets, and processed foods while satiety hormones, such as leptin, are blunted.

                Some tips for nailing a good sleep routine. It does require discipline to establish – like anything – once established, it will just be the norm.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Set a bed-time alarm for going to sleep. For me, now it’s 10pm. This requires discipline, yes, but most people need to get to bed earlier in order to get more sleep as the time they wake up is usually pretty fixed.</li>
                <li>Try not to eat within 2h of sleeping.</li>
                <li>Caffeine – Caffeine stays in your system for a long time time!half life is 6h, quarter life is 12h. What this means is if you have a flat white at 12pm (which has 2 shots of espresso), this is equivalent to having 1/2 an espresso 12 hours later. Enjoy you coffee, but have your last cup before midday.</li>
                <li>Alcohol – reduces time taken to fall asleep but disrupts sleep as it increases Non REM sleep. Ideally, drink no more than two units per day, and no closer than 4h before bed.</li>
                <li>Cool room - My bedroom is roasting as I’m on the top floor of an A rated house. Have a cool shower (not cold) before bed that will lower your body temp.</li>
                <li>Turn off your devices - an hour before bed. You have likely heard this before. The blue light plays havoc with your circadian rhythm.</li>
                <li>Watch what you eat - Did you know the way you eat can affect sleep quality? Inflammatory foods, such as trans fats, fried foods, alcohol, and sugars send your body into stress mode. This, in turn, prevents that ever-so-important switch in to the parasympathetic state. By eating poorly, you raise cortisol levels as your body tries to process all of that junk. In general, athletes should focus on eating real food. That is food without a label.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Ironically, trouble sleeping can be a symptom of overtraining, as your heart is working overtime to protect your muscles, nerves, and immune system. Sprinkle in a littleu bad mood and anxiety, and sleep can be a big issue. That’s why one of the best ways to maximize sleep is to not only train hard, but recover harder. Watch out for this.
