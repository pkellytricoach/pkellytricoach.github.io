            <p>Sport/Training/Adaptations are not and never can be linear. We just can’t keep pressing on and on and on and expect to yield more and more results. That is why we need a break. We need to take a step back. After our short break – a week or two. We must start again and not keep the same intensity that we have become accustomed too. It is a cycle and we find ourselves at the start of the cycle regardless of where you currently are/were (trying to win your age group etc). Its a stage of training that is preventative and preparatory in nature. It is all about improving tissue integrity and mental and physical readiness to absorb the upcoming work. We want to lay and prepare the body to absorb that work. It is a time with the lowest overhead in terms of physical load and training hours. Nice!</p>

            <p>It lays the technical platform for future training.The biggest factor is that a successful post season is going to diminish the risk of your future injury. You can do something that will lower the risk of your future injury. It’s a phase of training where we are not actively looking for linear fitness gains. We are not looking to develop our FTP or swim CSS. Instead it’s preparatory, to use my coaches term, its more wax on wax off through repetition, loving the process and building durability via consistency. We want to get stronger, developing motor skills and let other important factors improve as a by product of the consistency. This period typically lasts about 6-9 weeks. At the heart of it, consistency is clearest, identifiable factor for athletes who experience breakthroughs and success in upcoming years.</p>

            <p>Skipping this phase is common. Lots of people are tired after structured training for the majority of the year and want a timeout. So October to January – no structured training. Reverts to exercise. Random exercise, the odd swim, spin class. Bit of yoga. We have all been there. Whats the issue with this? Come January, after an indulgent few months. It is ON! A very quick ramp into very strong training! The outcome, we are playing catchup. We have missed these months where we couldn’t have really developed. Injury risk is higher because of low muscle readiness to accept the new load. Consistency is lost!</p>

            <p>We want to use the offseason effectively with some breathing room to enjoy other things in life but still maintaining consistency. We want to lay the platform to success. The specificity is very important however. This is what we are going to work on:</p>

            <p>Motor Skills / Technique</p>

            <p>We want to develop leg speed and efficiency, this will probably involve lots of treadmill work. The efforts are short, so you will not be aerobically taxed from the session. Because the intervals are very short, the recovery will be quicker also.</p>

            <p>Strength Training</p>

            <p>During off season is VERY important to keep all the strength you gained during the season or to keep building for the upcoming season. A common mistake usually seen is to STOP the specific sessions and only focus on base easy miles.</p>

            <p>Nail down your habits</p>

            <p>As life fills up and training program fills up with hard work, there becomes less willpower to integrate new and positive habits that support your journey (focus on sleep / diet / strength training etc). Whatever the habits are, this is the time to begin.</p>

            <p>LCHF HRV readings each morning Optimise sleep routine Morning hydration Daily foam-rolling Morning mobility Race Season planning</p>

            <p>Plan your year, what are your main races? Sign up for them and commit.</p>

            <p>Target your weaknesses</p>

            <p>People tend to veer toward what they enjoy most. For me, I’d like to nail a couple of run PB’s. But it’s not big picture. Ultimately I want to be a complete triathlete and need to devote time in the water to become one. Personally, I hope to keep swimming 8-10k a week over the next few months. I could do more, but I want to back off also, so the hunger is there when I need it most.</p>

            <p>Most important – Consistency We are on an mental and physical break, but we are still looking to keep a solid foundation of long-term smart consistency that we can leverage in racing later in the year. Let’s say it again, Consistency is key!</p>
