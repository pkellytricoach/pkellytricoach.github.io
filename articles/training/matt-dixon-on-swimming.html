            <p>Matt dixon did an excellent podcast over on his 'Purple Patch' podcast. It's excellent. Thoroughly
                recommend a listen.
                'Cures for the adult onset swimmer'. The main points from this show are below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Swimming wonderful for cardiovascular conditioning</li>
                <li>Triathletes tend to relegate it as it is frustrating and the shortest portion of the day in 70.3 /
                    Ironman
                </li>
                <li>Relegation mindset is a mistake</li>
                <li>Swim has a large impact on race day performance</li>
                <li>Effects of swim felt in bike, which are felt on run.</li>
                <li>Swimming is a wonderful tool for conditioning. Higher speeds higher efforts without the need for as
                    much recovery
                </li>
                <li>Really positive cross pollination effect into other disciplines.</li>
                <li>Jesse Thomas had swim blocks of 50% of training. Improved swimming, but also improved as a
                    triathlete.
                </li>
                <li>‘I can maybe only gain a minute’ - wrong mindset. Has massive value for you across all
                    disciplines.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Mistakes triathletes make</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Drill your way to glory</li>
                <li>Triathletes aim to mimic highly trained swimmers</li>
                <li>Ploughing up and down, no intensity. Low yield, return on investment. Like going for a super slow
                    jog
                </li>
                <li>Increasing distance per stroke - very pretty and very slow. Instead we need to develop a fast and
                    sustainable stroke rate without losing power and a strong pull
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What do we need to do</h4>

            <h5>Technical</h5>


            <ul>
                <li>Minimise drills - ok in Off-Season for a short while</li>
                <li>Lean into toys. Improve conditioning as a side effect, can make more enjoyable, which leads to greater consistency and conditioning</li>
                <li>We need to improve body position, good posture. Can’t wiggle down the pool.Reduce drag with good alignment. Taut body. Make every single pull MEANINGFUL. You need to ACCELERATE water back. This is what creates the propulsion.</li>
                <li>So efforts with (Snorkel / Pull Buoy / Band) - helps with taut posture and rhythm.</li>
                <li>Hand Entry - As a hand enters the water, Let the SHOULDER slide forward. Don’t pull back with just the hand. Anchor it down, finger tips under wrist, under elbow and then vault the body past the ‘ANCHORED HAND’.</li>
                <li>It’s this connection between pulling arm and opposite hip that generates the propulsion.</li>
                <li>You are not seeking perfection in your stroke. Good enough will do.</li>
                <li>You will need to swim a tonne in your ‘3 swims a week’ swims. </li>
                <li>In the swimming that you are doing need to be heavily anchored down in intervals. </li>
                <li>Favour SHORT intervals over long intervals. As an adult onset swimmer, You simply cannot maintain great form and technique and super force per stroke over long intervals.</li>
                <li>You will get a better yield over shorter and HIGHER INTENSITY intervals. You get a mental break each 25/50s or so. You get great prioproception of speed over those intervals. </li>
                <li>Example session 2 x (40 x 25s) - 3 fast 1 easy. 40 chances to drive off the wall and streamline (practicing tautness). They are MASTERPIECE 25s! We get a break for 5-10s so we can have that reset.</li>
                <li>This is a type of session my coach Kristian, Siri Lindley, Plews and Sutto would recommend also.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Think that about sums up that podcast. Really enjoyed it. Go and have a listen</p>
