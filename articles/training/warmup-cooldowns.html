            <h4 class="mb-5">The importance of warm ups and cool downs</h4>
            <p> We normally do 15/20 mins of warm up/cool downs in our sessions. Why?</p>

            <p>Warm up An easy warm up increases blood flow to the muscles, which enhances the delivery of oxygen and
                nutrients to our cells. This allows the removal of waste products. This is why sometimes when we start
                our exercise we feel sluggish, but after 20 mins we come to life. At least this is the case for me. So
                always give at least 20 mins of your workout. If you are still feeling crap after 20 mins, then
                something is up with your body. Back off and have an easy session of finish there and then and come back
                stronger tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Cool down Our bodies are designed to move. A cooldown after a race or hard training effort is especially
                important. Effort should be easy. The key is simply to pump nutrient dense blood from your heart through
                your arteries to all your different cells. That same blood picks up metabolic waste and removes it
                through our kidneys via our veins. This whole process is facilitated by movement. The goal of these cool
                downs is never to gain fitness, more to expedite recovery. </p>
