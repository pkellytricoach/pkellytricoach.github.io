            <p>Tight Hip Flexors Itâ€™s very hard to not have tight hip flexors after being in a TT position for 5+ hours.
                As triathletes, we are going to have tight hip flexors after the IM bike, because our hip flexors are
                tight, it prohibits the amount of extension we can get. A typical runner wants good extension out the
                back of a running stride, extension is created through the glutes and hamstrings. We are not typical
                runners. So the long stride / slow cadence just wonâ€™t work in Ironman running. Overstriding by default
                results in more impact per strike which in turn break the muscle tissue down more.</p>

            <p>We incorporate daily mobility work each morning that opens up our hip flexors, this will help and is
                needed. Continuing our mobility work and focusing in our running on a shorter snappier stride allows for
                your foot-strike to happen underneath your hips, you are recruiting more fatigue resistant muscles
                (glutes and hamstrings) and opposed to quads (which have more fast twitch fibers and fatigue easily)</p>

            <p>We will be doing lots of neuro + strength work over the off season where high cadence is a focus on the
                run and low cadence on the bike to maintain strength. We are also trying to nail the daily mobility
                routine which will help opening up our hip flexors (also, paying special attention to the psoas video
                foam rolling video, this helps with our hip mobility and under-active glutes).</p>

            <p>Take a look at Tim Reeds instagram. He is an excellent 70.3 athlete, but has really failed to do it at
                ironman. He mentions a bunch of potential fixes. He highlights that it is a strength endurance event
                after a 180km bike. He also thinks his low cadence running could be a problem. His quads are smashed
                after 21km ðŸ™‚</p>
