            <p>The reverse periodization model for triathletes is based on starting training blocks building a foundation that involves, technique, strength and speed rather than laying an aerobic endurance base, as with traditional periodization models.</p>

            <p>Obviously it made no sense adding volume in training when the basic foundation of skills were not yet developed!</p>

            <p>How much can we gain by adding extra slow miles to our training in the early season? 2 or 3% in performance? Now how much can we gain by developing proper motor skills and technique, strength and speed? A lot more than that I can assure you.</p>

            <p>Further, doing too much volume or long intense sessions all year round is one sure way to destroy the body’s immune function, endocrine balance and biomechanical health for very long durations due to highly catabolic approaches to training. Little explosive speed or strength built into their training, and a general lack of emphasis on basic motor skill development. As a result, the strong focus on aerobic “gains” (catabolic) without the corresponding balance of more anabolic training sessions leads to increasing breakdown, generally evident in increasingly poor performances, greater fatigue, more injuries.</p>

            <p>Reverse Periodization applies training stimulation of carefully selected fitness components for a set block of time, an approach sometimes referred to as “Block Periodization.” (Dr. Vladimir Issurin)</p>

            <p>For most athletes, the long endurance base training is done in the winter and spring months, so by March or April, athletes are at the highest level of endurance possible. But unfortunately for most athletes, they end up racing in June and July and by this time; the level of endurance is lower than when they started in April. If we look at a triathlon event itself, where endurance is 85% of the race, we want to arrive at the race at the highest endurance level possible. The same is true for the racing season—we want our highest levels of endurance at race time.</p>

            <p>By doing your endurance training close to the race instead, the athlete will race with a higher aerobic capacity. As we know, contrary to speed, motor skills and strength, endurance is the easiest to gain but also the easiest to lose. And for athletes living in North America and Europe, trying to log long miles on the bike and run can be challenging during winter and most of spring season.</p>

            <p>As an athlete, particularly if you have been training for a while, it is so much easier to gain endurance than speed. So, when athletes spend 3 or 4 months doing only endurance, they end up staying away from speed workouts far too long. When they get back to speed work, they lost most of their last season speed, mobility, elasticity and strength. It makes the process of getting fast again longer and more difficult. It is important to do speed work all year long so that you never lose speed to any great extent. We start doing speed work at the beginning of the training season. The basic principle is that we are trying to get to as high a speed as possible before we put on the volume. This is what we call inverse periodization.</p>

            <p>As the training process and athletes start a training cycle specifically for long distance races (½ IM and up), intensity is reduced and volume increased. If the athletes didn’t bring their speed base to a very high level, they’re never going to get faster, because as we know, they’ll lose some speed during the high volume phase. The question I’m sure many of you have is, what about the endurance? If you do focus on speed early in the preparation cycle, will endurance suffer? The answer, and it is important to remember, for an experienced athlete, you don’t need more than 6-8 weeks to get your endurance back to a higher level. Another thing to remember is that you don’t give up endurance altogether when you do your speed training. Endurance happens as a by-product of all the other training. </p>        </div>
