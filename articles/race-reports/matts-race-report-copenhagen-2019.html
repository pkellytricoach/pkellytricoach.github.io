            <p>Having done sub 10 in 2018 for the first time, I felt sub 9.30 was a realistic goal this year.</p>

            <p>My approach to the year was to take things much more low key i.e. keep training and be fit without getting hugely hung up on being really specific too early in the year. Don’t endlessly talk about training / ironman at home etc. In February I did a half marathon mountain race but fell during the race and I didn’t train for 10 days or so due to stitches in my knee. Otherwise the build-up injury wise was pretty smooth.</p>

            <p>I did a good few sportif events this year (Westport/Wicklow Mountain Challenge/Wicklow 200/Majora 225k) which meant I got good mileage into the legs while also keeping things socialable.</p>

            <p>Race wise I only got 1 race done (Harbourman Olympic) in advance. I had planned another in Dunmore East which got canned due to travel and another (Half Ironman in Tyrone) due to a mishap with GPS going wrong which meant we got to the race late. In hindsight – it would have been really useful to do the half Ironman race for prepping race practise and doing a decent run on tired legs.</p>

            <p>Work was also busier this year and in June alone I was in NYC (twice) as well as London which does disrupt things particularly on swimming where it is harder to find facilities compared with just getting to a spin class or getting out for a run.</p>

            <p>Overall I was reasonable confident going into the race. I had a few decent swim sessions, I was happy I could at least match last year’s bike time and my run had definitely improved. 2nd year in Copenhagen meant the logistics for the race went really smoothly. Everything from registration, bike check-in and getting set-up on race morning all went fine.</p>

            <p>Similar to last year I went off in the first 30 swimmers and straight away found some decent feet and pretty much stayed on them the whole way around. 55.46 was marginally slower than last year but given my swim training was definitely down on last year was pretty happy with that. Was 4th in my AG and 31 overall. If only I had these positions in the swim and bike!</p>

            <p>On to the bike and power was reading on the garmin straight away unlike last year. The first 15k or so out of the city are technical enough but good fun. Was definitely more relaxed about the bike this time and determined to enjoy it. felt I was pushing a reasonable power and legally trying to make the most of the traffic around me. Even exchanged a couple of words with Fernando Feuntes who I cycled near for part of the bike. Got to the first water station without incident and felt that was progress already given my saddle issues last year. Mentally I split the course into 3 – the way out (40k or so), the traverse across country to the main road (25k or so) and back in the main road (25k or so). The middle 25k is quite technical and with some lumps hard to get into a decent rhythm. Overall though was moving nicely and kept an eye on my power. Again my HR was pretty high after the swim but it pretty much averaged 150 coming down gradually to mid 140s at the end. This is higher than I normally see during training spins but like last year HR is already relatively high after the swim and definitely doesn’t feel too high.</p>

            <p>On the second lap keeping a lower cadence became a challenge but still happy with 83RPM overall. 4.55.13 overall time 31st in my AG and 112th overall. This was about 6 minutes better than last year but funnily enough last year was 23rd in my AG. Just shows it depends who turns up! Love T2 where the bike is handed straight away to race volunteers – really feels like that real deal compared to the normal racking process.</p>

            <p>My legs off the bike had been good all year except for 1 run after the one 5 hour turbo. I hoped they would feel as good on race day. Alas it wasn’t to be.</p>

            <p>Legs felt heavy initially and I knew then it wasn’t going to be straight forward. From last year, my big goal was to get to turnaround point on lap 3 and then hope that with just 1.5 laps to go it I’d have the legs to get me home running. Laps 1 and 2 were uneventful bar a trip to the toilet on lap 2 which was a sign of things to come. Another lesson here is not to focus on time too much – I was forever doing calculations my head about what I needed to do etc and when coming around to the end of lap 2 my time was pretty close to 1.45 which in my head told me a 3.30 marathon was going to be very hard to do and so sub 9.30 was slipping away. Once on to lap 3 was thinking to remember this is supposed to hurt so tried to pick up the pace. I kept going until I had the 3rd band. Running back towards the end of lap 3 I hit a wall. I didn’t have the same emotions as last year about walking – this time I knew I just needed to keep going and hopefully get moving again – the world wasn’t going to end. Which I did once Paul had passed me out! ☺. Had a relatively long (2 min) toilet break on lap 4. Might have benefited from taking it earlier who knows.</p>

            <p>I managed to get in under 9.44 overall so nice to be under 9.45. 7 minutes faster overall.</p>

            <p>Rain at the end meant we didn’t hang around long after but again logisitics with ship my bike are super. We were back at the apt in no time.</p>

            <p>Lessons this year:</p>

            <p>- It’s possible to do ironman and enjoy it without it being the be all and end all of the year. I went to plenty of gigs at weekends and mid week as well as getting plenty of sociable cycling done.</p>

            <p>- While all of my race day nutrition had been practiced in training, I should try 1 or 2 sessions which I’m taking the volume of nutrition I would in IM to get stomach used to it.</p>

            <p>- Improving my running economy will be even more important as I try to get faster.</p>

            <p>- Strength training with Nessa is still really important.</p>

            <p>- Mental resilience on the run: Need to get through the really tough bits better. Both years I’ve managed to get going again which tells me it’s there. I can suffer on the turbo by putting the head down the grinding it out. Need to learn to suffer on the run in the same way.</p>

            <p>- My Zurich time 9 years ago given the training/strength I had at the time gets better with time.</p>
