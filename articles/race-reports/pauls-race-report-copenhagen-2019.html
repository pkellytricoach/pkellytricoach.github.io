            <p>This was the first year I put together two Ironman races. Honestly it went really well. Last year, post
                Hamburg I felt really unmotivated and just going through the motions in my prep for Cascais 70.3
                (Awesome race btw). This year not so. I think having the 2 week holiday in Tuscany at a family wedding
                really broke up the build. I really only had 6 hard weeks plus 3-4 easier weeks if you include the
                holiday. As I did for Lanza, I didn't sweat numbers and just adopted consistency as my most important
                measuring stick. Throw in 10 days of taper, I was good to toe the line again.</p>

            <p>Here is a summary of the hours I did post Lanza this year</p>

            <p>Insert graphic</p>

            <p>I also got to race this year in between the two races which was awesome. Did the Base2Race Harbourman
                national champs placing 2nd in my age group (lucked out! and not for the first time this year as you
                will find out later). This was a super race, great crowd and atmosphere. </p>

            <p>Copenhagen</p>

            <p>I made the trip over to Copenhagen with Matt, Niall and Jane. Niall + Jane were our supporters for the
                weekend. Matt had been there the year previously and knew the lay of the land. Thank god for this.
                Definitely tricky in terms of logistics. Bike drop offs, race registration and bike collection from
                Shipmytri. Think Dublin 70.3 a few years ago where you had split transitions. The expo was excellent,
                located on the grounds of the Danish Architecture Centre. Copenhagen is really really cool. Definitely
                recommend a visit if you have never been. Pricey, but slick.</p>

            <p>In the 6-7 weeks prior to the race, I had a backdrop on my phone. "I'm a 9'20s athlete". Set big
                audacious goals. Shoot for the moon etc. While it was a goal, it wasn't a time I was fixated on
                achieving or talk about, it was just there lurking in the lead up to the race :) </p>

            <p>Swim</p>

            <p>Swim is really beautiful. Stunning area of Copenhagen and great support. Sighting was easy. All going
                well for me till about 3k where I definitely lost focus. For some reason I felt I was almost finished
                and realised that I had another 800m or so. Bit deflated and lack of focus here. Took the foot off the
                gas. Exited and was happy to see 1'06. This was a PB of 1 min for me. </p>

            <p>Bike</p>

            <p>I found the bike course a bit dull to be honest. Support was ok and course a bit boring. The first 10k or
                so was great fun as you are navigating through streets out of the city. It's a pretty flat course (think
                about 700m of total elevation), however its quite technical and definitely windy, never really felt like
                I had the wind. Its quite hard to find a groove as there are lots of sharp turns and false flats. In
                terms of pacing, I took the first 2.5 hours very handy, then upped the effort on the second lap. Coming
                back into the city is amazing. Support was brilliant here. Awesome to hand over your bike to one of the
                ironman support crew and head to your transition. </p>

            <p>Run</p>

            <p>Weather was a bit drizzly starting off the run. Settled into a groove earlier. Looked at my watch and
                seeing I was running a little fast. Backed off. Ten mins later, I checked again to find I was running at
                the same speedy pace. Decided to just go with it. Run was amazing. There was a 1-2k stretch on the 4
                loop course that I thought was a bit of a lull in terms of atmosphere, everywhere else though it was
                electric. People out in their droves. Amazing stuff. I knew I was on the edge of my run throughout but
                just kept hanging in there. The last 4-5k I was really starting to slow down. Using all the mental
                tricks to get me through this spell. The weather didn't help here. The rain was torrential. Really
                heavy. Deep puddles everywhere. As there was a bit of cobbles on the course which made the surface
                really slippy in parts. The rain did hold off for 90% of the day however. I knew I was sub 10, however,
                I really had no idea of my overall time as I don't allow myself to look at this as I think it will screw
                with my effort. Chuffed to see 9:33 on the finishing clock. </p>

            <p>The timing of the torrential downpour was a little disappointing as it took away from the post race
                finish area. People didn't hang around. It was too wet and cold. My lips were turning blue
                apparently. </p>

            <p>Really happy with the race and weekend away with good friends. The next morning/afternoon was spent
                drinking coffee + eating cakes in a super cool market in Copenhagen before flying home. Super
                weekend. </p>

            <p>As it turns out I would have picked up a roll-down spot for Kona if we went to the awards ceremony. It
                was never an option for me financially. But was chuffed to qualify. Some day :) Best start saving. </p>

            <p>So I did 5 rides outside this year. 2 in Lanzarote on a family holiday. 1 @ Ironman Lanza, 1 @
                Harbourman, 1 @ Ironman Copenhagen. Turbo training is not for everyone, but certainly ticks the box for
                me.</p>
