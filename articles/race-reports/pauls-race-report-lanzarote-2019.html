            <p>Lanza was always bucket list race for me, it’s one of the oldest Ironmans on the calendar. And well, a
                beast. When Daragh mentioned he had signed up. The dates suited me this year with a holiday/family
                wedding in Italy mid-June that scuppered a lot of other races earlier in that June/July period time. I
                entered.</p>

            <p>I went into this race with a solid winter training behind me. There was nothing crazy or testing in any
                of my training, I simply adopted a mindset where my most important measuring stick was day in day out
                consistency. Definitely not the pace and power of my intervals. No session left me wiped to miss a
                session the following day. </p>

            <p>From mid-November to mid-March, my training volume averaged 11 hours a week. Typically 3 swim/bike/run
                and short S&C after all my runs. I think given that I do all my riding indoors on a turbo and run to
                work to comprise most of my run volume, this really didn’t have any effect on family life. This is key
                for me. I never want my hobby (one I love, but undeniably a selfish one) to interfere with family. My
                mornings are everything. It’s a use it or lose it for me while the kids are sleeping. If I don’t train
                in the mornings, it doesn’t get done. I want the evenings free for the gang. </p>

            <p>(PREP PHASE)</p>

            <p>In the last 11 weeks leading into the race, the volume upped to about 14.5 hours average a week. With 2-3
                quite big weeks in that 17-19 hour range. Really my long ride got a bit longer, and I added an extra
                bike to make up 4 rides. </p>

            <p>(PREP PHASE)</p>

            <p>I’m particularly pleased looking back with my swim volume. I averaged 8.5k a week for over 6 months. This
                was the consistency I was looking for from the previous years.</p>

            <p>(SWIM VOLUME)</p>

            <p>The distribution of my training over the course of 6+ months looked like this:</p>

            <p>(Training distribution)</p>

            <p>Race day</p>

            <p>I was really looking forward to the day. It was good to know a few going too. Daragh had put in a super
                block of training and another friend Barry has done this race 4 times in a row. He is going back next
                year to get his special 5 in-a-row medal. </p>

            <p>I wrote down my objective for the race in the weeks prior which was the following</p>

            <p>‘Give it my best effort and make only positive memories. Effort and attitude, all I can control. Time for
                this race is honestly irrelevant to me. However, I really hope I can respond in a positive way when the
                shit is hitting the fan.’</p>

            <p>My only goal was to give my best effort and make good memories. Effort and attitude was an excerpt I got
                from the cool book ‘The Brave Athlete: Calm the F*ck Down and Rise to the Occasion’. And making only
                good memories from the race was a promise I made to myself. No matter what happened during the day, I
                was going to smile and embrace whatever it threw at me in a positive way. Effort and attitude, the only
                controllable’s.</p>

            <p>(RACE MORNING SELFIE)</p>

            <p>The swim Myself and Daragh went in for a swim the day before, it was absolutely beautiful. Crystal clear.
                How different it was going to be the next morning when 1400 people run from the beach. The swim was
                carnage, no rolling starts here.. Jaysis. Kicks and wrestling a go go. I was actually thinking a gum
                shield wouldn’t be a bad idea. People don’t mean it, it just happens. For the first lap, it didn’t let
                up. I seen the clock during the Australian exit and it was 33 mins and change. Great, that's perfect
                considering the carnage. The next lap was definitely choppier and the current seemed stronger. Strange
                in such a short time. From a swimming perspective, it got easier as groups had spread out and I got a
                good draft for the last 8-900 meters and felt I was swimming strong, So I was a little surprised to see
                I swam 4 mins slower on the second lap. Must have been the chop + current, some others I chatted to
                repeated this also. Not to worry, set and forget.</p>

            <p>The bike I had been here a month prior with my family and got out for 2 spins on the course. As it turns
                out they were the easy stretches of the course. Doh, oh well. It was brutal in an epic way. Actually
                comical to be honest, you do one crazy climb into headwind then wonder what Mother Nature will throw
                your way at the (seemingly) top of the climb. Yes, another climb into a headwind. Sometimes descending
                into the wind putting down power and seeing 17k an hour on the speedo. Jaysis. There was also stretches
                where you were descending with a tailwind downhill hitting crazy speeds. Which was crazy as the
                crosswinds were quite unnerving. Look down at my speedo and go, woah, I have 2 young kids at home. Slow
                the F’ down! I really think it’s a course where you can do any different day and could have up to 90 min
                difference plus or minus each day depending on the conditions. I felt good during the ride most of the
                ride with the exception of the last 20k where I was over the bike. It had well and truly battered me.
                Thoughts of a marathon were taking their toll. The little voices in my head were telling me there was no
                point in smashing the run, cruise and enjoy. Ya di ya. Time to get tough. This is what you came for. You
                do hard things.</p>

            <p>Run</p>

            <p>One foot in front of the other. That was my mantra for the duration. Patience early. Get into a groove. I
                was really trying to dial into how I felt. Did it feel hard? If so dial back. Everything I have been
                doing all day rests on the back half of this run. High five the kids, count backward, anything to take
                the mind of the blisters that had developed. The different road surfaces were so noticeable which I’m
                sure you wouldn’t notice on a normal run. Amazing what really annoys you late in a race. Cadence and
                pace were the only things I was looking at during the run. Had no idea of time till I got to turnarounds
                on the run course. The last 10k I really had to dig deep, I had no time goal but I did want to push hard
                to the end and choose not to ease up when my body was screaming at me to do so.</p>

            <p>All in all, a tough but very rewarding day. I swore that day I’d never do that race again. A few days on
                I’m tempted to give it another go. Amazing how quickly you forget the pain. Need to unpack the
                experience a bit more but I think I hit my original race objectives. Lots of learnings and lots to be
                happy with - stayed positive for most (apart from that real lull in the last stretch on the bike),
                smiled and thanked all the volunteers, and high fived the kids on the run. I was patient when needed and
                dug deep at the end. Happy days. Hardest Ironman in the world? Certainly the hardest this ironman has
                ever done.</p>
